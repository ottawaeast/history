      <p>&quot;<b>EDITORIAL<br>
        The Mainstreeter</b></p>
      <p>What is THE MAINSTREETER? Answering the question takes me back to the 
        September opening of the Main Street Comm-unity Centre at De Mazenod School. 
        I saw children running around that day wearing buttons saying &quot;I'm 
        a Mainstreeter&quot;. Not only that, I heard them shout it out and I'm 
        sure it made them feel good.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The Mainstreeter hopes to be an effective community voice that makes 
        you feel good. We hope it will make the community feel good about its 
        people, the scenery and the potential for new and exciting things to happen 
        here.</p>
      <p>Tile Mainstreeter is pub1ished by the Ottawa East Community Activities 
        Group (CAG), a volunteer group which has been active in social and recreational 
        activities in the community for almost ten years. Given this relationship, 
        the Mainstreeter's editorial policy will, to some extent, reflect and 
        share CAG's direction and goals. In its capacity as the community management 
        group at the Main Street Community Centre, CAG has a vision that sees 
        the Centre and the newspaper as stimu1ants to help meet our community's 
        development needs. These needs include daycare, education, recreation 
        and economic development.</p>
      <p>What our community's needs are exactly, how they should be met and who 
        should be involved are all topics of discussion that we hope to share 
        with you. This shopping list is, however, incomplete. It's up to you to 
        tell us what else needs to be discussed. We'll strive to do this in an 
        unbiased, objective and open way.</p>
      <p>A PLACE TO HAVE FUN:</p>
      <p>If you think we're going to be totally serious, forget it. The Mainstreeter 
        is going to have fun as well. In up-coming issues we intend to have regular 
        features on music, games, cooking and anything else you can think of.</p>
      <p>ELECTION TIME:</p>
      <p>A major feature of our first issue is the upcoming munici-pal election, 
        both at the community and city levels. For the past several weeks many 
        of you have been thinking about or have openly voiced issues that you 
        feel need to be addressed. Are recent housing developments detrimental 
        or beneficial to the community? What can be done to stimulate job creation 
        on a local basis? The Mainstreeter had a chat with the candidates for 
        alderman to see how they would meet these challenges. I think you'll find 
        the results interesting. </p>
      <p><br>
        VOLUNTEERS:</p>
      <p>The Mainstreeter is produced by an all volunteer staff and my thanks 
        go to them for helping to get this started. We think there's lots of room 
        for the newspaper to grow and look forward to your innovation and participation 
        to make it happen.&quot;</p>
