        of art and beauty - with ever added charms as the work progresses. </p>
      <p>Others increase with the dull monotony and commonplace of the brick wall 
        under the hands of the mason mechanic - where every added brick is exactly 
        like the brick that was laid before - and the result is a cheerless mass 
        of red oblongs and grey mortar streaks.</p>
      <p>Ottawa - up to now - has grown on the brick wall plan. <br>
        Every added section has been just like the one before.<br>
        Another regulation brick. <br>
        Even its best residential sections - the Glebe - Sandy Hill - are never- 
        ending rectangles and straight streets.</p>
      <p>The only exceptions are the work of the Ottawa Improvement Association, 
        who have engrafted on to the brick wall a little rococo and decorative 
        embellish-ment - by turning the waste places and the eyesores into beautiful 
        drives and parkways.</p>
      <p>The time was ripe for a change - the change has come.<br>
        A new high class residential section is being developed.<br>

        Ornamental-useful-attractive and charming.<br>

      <p>Brantwood Place is in Ottawa East-well within the city limits. For a 
        quarter of a mile on the east it has a beautiful frontage on a broad and 
        lake-like spread of the Rideau River. This frontage is to be devoted to 
        a drive and parkway along the lines of the Improvement Commission's development.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This entire tract - with its beautiful vista to the east and south has 
        been laid out with winding roadways and curved crescents into a boulevarded 
        and parked, highly restricted residence district. Massive ornamental entrance 
        gates - shade trees - well kept and carefully made roadways-island parks 
        at street intersections and granolithic walks are all in the plan.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The land starts from the high banks of the Rideau River, and runs back 
        with a gentle slope to the highest point at the western boundary - Main 
        Street.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The property already has many beautiful shade trees scattered over its. 
        area and the plan includes the transplanting of trees in the boulevards 
        along both sides of the roads and crescents.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Being in the city - it will have all city improvements and conveniences.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Water - sewers - telephone and electric lights are all available.<br>
      </p>
      <p>It is even now but l2 minutes walk from the end of either the Elgin Street 
        or the Bank Street car lines to the property - with granolithic walks 
        all the way up Main Street - its western front. .<br>

      <p align="center"><b><font size="4">Ottawa - City of Remarkable Growth </font></b></p>
      <p>Ottawa is steadily forging ahead. Its growth and development in the last 
        ten years has been nothing short of phenomenal - when a cold analytical 
        review of the facts and figures is made.</p>
      <p>Its population in 1901 was about 60,000 - in 1911 is about 90,000 - without 
        mentioning an additional 25,000 in what may be rightly called &quot;Suburban 
        Ottawa.&quot;</p>
      <p>Think of a growth of 50% in the first instance - or about 100% - in the 
        second.</p>
      <p>Its assessed valuation in 1901 was about $25,000,000 - in 1911 is about 
        $63,250,000.<br>
        <br>
        Think of an increase of over 150% - in ten short years. </p>
      <p>But this wonderful record is only an indication of what may be expected 
        in the future. Nothing can stem the tide of Ottawa's growth. For it is 
        a city of untold advantages. Its cheap and abundant electric power - its 
        many lines of rail and water highways - its central and convenient location 
        - its nearness to the sources of raw material-form a powerful attraction 
        for the location of manufacturing industries in many lines. Its strategic 
        position as the seat of the Federal Government - making it as it does 
        the headquarters of all the official departments -adds a permanent and 
        pros-perous population of those in the civil service which is bound to 
        increase steadily from year to year with the growth and development of 
        the great Dominion. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The whole nation contributes to the growth and prosperity of its CapitalCity. 
        Its destiny is great. And Ottawa with double its present population is 
        no idle dream in the near future. </p>

      <p>Ottawa of to-day is but a promise of the-Ottawa of tomorrow. Land values 
        within the limits of a big city are always the result of supply and demand.</p>
      <p>As the city grows - the values go up. Every new house built-every im-provement 
        added - helps the whole. Low priced vacant land of to-day becomes the 
        high priced improved property of tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Automatically - with the spread of the city and increase in population 
        - it doubles and trebles in price - making investments in city lots the

      <p>&quot;I beseech you all most earnestly-I beseech you all to plan not

        and my only regret is that they did not acquire the south side of Wellington 
        Street also. I hope that the men of 1950 in the same way will praise the 
        men of 1911 for planning the city's growth. I believe in the future greatness
