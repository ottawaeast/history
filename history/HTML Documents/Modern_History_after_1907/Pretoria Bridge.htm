    <td>The waterways that created the original independence of the village of 
      Ottawa East later became formidable barriers to travel and commerce. In 
      the 1870's, when Archville was established, there was little need for a 
      readily accessible crossing over the river or canal. Most business was conducted 
      in the city that could be reached via the Canal Road along the east bank 
      of the canal. The &quot;Glebe&quot; was a collection of market gardens and 
      across the Rideau River were large farms accessed via the Hurdman Bridge.

    <td>By the end of the 1880's however, the demand for a connection between 
      the village and Elgin St. intensified. Many villagers now made their living 
      in the city and the lack of a convenient connection to downtown was a hardship. 
      In 1889 the federal government agreed to build a swing bridge from Argyle 
      Ave. to Cedar St. (Harvey St. projected). Completed in 1890 the bridge was 
      set on timber cribs filled with rock and the superstructure was made of 
      iron and wood. While convenient for pedestrians and horse-drawn wagons, 
      it could not accommodate heavy loads of brick, coal or wood. This bridge 
      is often referred to as the Argyle or Archville Bridge.

    <td colspan="2">From this point on there was continuous discussion between 
      the federal authorities and the village council (and later the city) regarding 
      an additional bridge in the southern part of Ottawa East. Many favoured 
      a connection between Mutchmor St. (later Fifth Ave.) and Clegg St. This 
      idea persisted up to 1955. 
      <p>In 1909 the city entered into negotiation with the Ministry of Railroads 
        and Canals and the Ottawa Improvement Commission (later the National Capital 
        Commission) to provide a &quot;high level&quot; bridge in the vicinity 
        of the swing bridge. One idea was to build a &quot;low level&quot; bridge 
        from Strathcona Ave. to Graham Ave. but the idea was discarded as being 
        inadequate for future needs.</p>
      <p>The wheels of government turn slowly as everyone knows and finally in 
        1914 the Ministry agreed to contribute $40,000 towards the operation and 
        maintenance of the bridge (City Report #5, March 2, #4, page 70). The 
        city Board of Control recommended that the bridge be built to connect 
        Pretoria Ave. with Hawthorne Ave. By October the city engineer had submitted 
        the plans for approval. The city report of January 18, 1915 (Report #2, 
        page 20) indicates the J. B. Strauss Co. of Chicago had received the contract 
        to build a &quot;direct lift bridge&quot; at the recommended location.<br>

    <td colspan="2">A history of the bridge prepared by the City of Ottawa Public

      the R. Brewder Co. for the substructure ($26,595); and the Dominion Bridge 
      Co. for the superstructure ($66,798). The city paid $120,000 and the federal 
      government contributed $40,000. The final agreement was signed on August 
      10, 1915 (No. 21557) and included a lease for use of the land along with 
      a stipulation that &quot;said bridge . . . be designed and used for carriage 
      of electric street railway traffic&quot;. With this requirement, Ottawa 
      East would now have public transit.</td>

      <p>The bridge opened for traffic on November 2, 1917 with a load capacity 
        of 12 tons. It was named after Pretoria Ave. which was the major traffic 
        approach from the west at the time. Isabella St. was used principally 
        for access to the rail yards that were adjacent (now the Queensway). Pretoria 
        Avenue (originally Jane St.) was named in 1902 after the capital of South 
        Africa. Council at that time wanted to commemorate the victory of the 
        British in the Boer War.</p>
      <p>The opening of the bridge had a profound effect on Ottawa East. The electric 
        trolley now connected the end of Elgin St., under the railway subway built 
        in 1903 to Clegg St. The small park that exists today at the corner of 
        Main and Clegg was originally used for the vehicle to turn around. Pretoria 
        Bridge now permitted the movement of heavy vehicles to and from the east-side 
        of the canal. It must be remembered that the original plan of the city 
        in annexing Ottawa East was to develop an &quot;industrial park&quot; 
        here. Coal and lumber that arrived by rail in the freight yards of Ottawa 
        East could now be delivered directly across the canal to the southern 
        part of the city. As well, daily truckloads of garbage could be efficiently 
        transported to the landfill (garbage dump) and incinerator sites at the 
        end of Lees Ave. This was to be Ottawa East's contribution to the &quot;Pittsburgh 
        of the North&quot; vision described in the annexation hyperbole of 1907. 
        The community continued to be the repository of city waste for decades 
        after. There is more on this story <a href="Lees%20Avenue.htm">here</a>.</p>

    <td colspan="2">There are many memories associated with Pretoria Bridge and 
      its operation. The bridge for example had an uncanny ability to become locked 
      in the &quot;up&quot; position especially at rush hour. Most early residents 
      will remember long lines of traffic stalled down Main St. and sitting in 
      their cars on sweltering afternoons impatiently watching the mast tips of 
      American luxury boats slowly sail under the bridge. A favourite activity 
      of local boys was to wait for the safety gates to close and then jump onto 
      the rising center span. With the bridge keeper busy at the controls, the 
      trick was to enjoy the ride and then jump down and run like hell as the 
      span descended. More fun than a video game! 
      <p>In 1956 the deck of the bridge was rebuilt at a cost of $140,000; traffic 
        approaches were altered in 1958; and extensive repairs were undertaken 
        to the bridge in 1963. In 1967 the city commissioned a study to investigate 
        other alternatives including a tunnel but nothing was done. The bridge 
        became the responsibility of the Regional Government in 1969 and with 
        increasing costs of operation and repair approved the complete rebuilding 
        of the bridge in April of 1977. In 1979 the bridge was demolished and 
        new underwater piers were built. A footbridge was constructed just north 
        of the location to accommodate pedestrians and bicycles. The contractor, 
        Hugh M. Grant, built the superstructure and installed the mechanical and 
        electrical systems in 1980. Final work was completed in 1981 for a total 
        cost of $5,280,252.<br>
