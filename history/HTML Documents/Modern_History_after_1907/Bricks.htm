    <td>It is hard to imagine Ottawa East as being rich in mineral resources but 
      that is in fact the case. From the 1870's to the early 1930's, the rich 
      clay and sand deposits found along the western edge of the Rideau River 
      were the main source of raw material for the production of brick and drainage 
      tile. This resource attracted men such as Horace O'Dell, John Graham and 
      John Cain to the area and resulted in the establishment of large brickworks 
      at the end of Lees Ave and Clegg St. 
      <p>The story begins about 13,000 years ago with the end of the Wisconsin 
        glacial period.<img src="../../Graphics/mersm.jpg" width="144" height="122" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="3" alt="Museum of Civilization map"> 
        With the retreat of the glacial ice, huge meltwater lakes were created 
        including the Champlain Sea. As the water levels receded, drainage channels 
        such as the Rideau River were created. The sedimentary deposits left by 
        this recession later became the basis for Ottawa East's first industry.<br>

      clay is comprised of fine particles laid down in standing water. Alluvial 
      refers to deposits from moving water. In general, a deep layer of silty 
      clay covered by fine alluvial sand is found in the Ottawa East area. It

    <td colspan="2"><b>Making Brick: </b> 
      <p>The brickmaking process utilized in the 1870's involved five steps beginning 
        with the removal of overlying sand to expose the clay deposits. This was 
        done in the fall as it allowed the freeze-thaw cycle in winter to break 
        the clay down, making it softer and removed unwanted oxides. This process 
        is called &quot;winning&quot; or mining the clay.</p>
      <p>The next step involved grinding the clay into powder and screening the 
        material to remove <img src="../Image%20Library/General/sm/X_pug%20mill.gif" width="202" height="140" align="right" alt="Horse driven pug mill mixing clay" vspace="3" hspace="3">stones.Sometimes 
        it was placed in soaking pits to obtain the correct consistency for moulding. 
        It then had to be kneaded to mix all the clay elements together. Called 
        tempering or pugging, it was done by hand until about the 1850's when 
        the horse driven pug mill came into use.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Moulding came next. Here a &quot;clot&quot; moulder would form a lump 
        and pass it to the brick moulder. He would roll it in sand and then &quot;dash&quot; 
        it into a sand-covered mould and remove the excess with a strike (a water-soaked 
        flat stick). Sand was used to prevent sticking to the mould. A team of 
        moulders; working 12 to 14-hour days could make up to 5,000 bricks in 
        a day. These bricks were referred to as &quot;sand struck&quot; or &quot;slop 
        moulded&quot; bricks. </p>

        to 1800 F. for a week. At this point the fire holes were bricked over 
        and the heat allowed to dissipate for another week.</p>

    <td colspan="2"><b>O'Dell Brickworks: </b> 
      <p>The 1871 Census (Schedule #6) offers a detailed view of early brick production 
        at the O'Dell Brickworks located on Lees Ave. approximately near the corner 
        of Simcoe St. The first local record of Horace O'Dell appears in the Nepean 
        Assessment Roll of 1865. He is listed as a brick manufacturer along with 
        an Amos O'Dell. The 1881 Census indicates that Horace was born in Germany 
        immigrated to the United States and then moved to Canada.</p>
      <p>In 1871 he made 1,500,000 bricks with an aggregate value of $9,000. To 
        do this he mined 3,000 cubic yards of clay and used 300 cords of wood 
        for the kiln. The work was seasonal (only 5 months) and employed 15 men 
        and 5 boys at a total wage cost of $2,000.</p>
      <p>From the municipal directory it appears that the O'Dell Company was no 
        longer in business by 1910 and there is no reference on the fire insurance 
        maps for that time period. The land record show that the family sold their 
        land in Concession D, Lot G about that time. A remnant of the brickwork's 
        excavations can be seen <a href="../Image%20Library/Airphotos/sm/X_AIR_1928%20crop%20clay.jpg">here</a> 
        in this 1928 air photo that shows one of the clay pits. There is more

    <td colspan="2"><b>Graham Brickworks: </b> 
      <p>John Graham owned the next oldest brickworks in Ottawa. The Ontario Land 
        Records show that he leased land in Concession D, Lot I in 1882. A subsequent 
        1885 lease (Instrument #10485) extended his right to excavate clay &quot;for 
        the purpose of making brick&quot;. The lease description suggests that 
        most of the excavation took place in the area of present-day Brantwood 
        Beach with Clegg St. as the main point of entry.</p>
      <p>John funded the operation but had little to do with the day-to-day operation 
        as this was left to his stepson<img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Brickyards%201918.jpg" width="195" height="221" align="right" alt="1918 Dept. of Militia and Defence Map - current as of 1906" vspace="3" hspace="3"> 
        Alexander. The earliest directory reference in 1890-91 under the name 
        of Gamman (Thomas) and Graham (Alexander) on the macadamized road (Main 
        St.). In 1896, the year John died, Alexander signed a ten year lease (Instrument 
        #17333) that permitted further clay excavation for the production of bricks 
        and drainage tile to a limit of &quot;3,500,000&quot; units. The map to 
        the right shows the location of the brickyard (B.Y.) at the end of Clegg 
        St. beside the river.</p>
      <p>By 1907 Alexander Graham was listed as a cement block manufacturer. The 
        next year the Cain Brick Company appeared at 161 Main St. This is more 
        than coincidental in that John P. Cain was part owner of the land originally 
        leased to Graham. When the ten-year lease ran out Cain established his 
        own brickyard. The Fire Insurance Map for this time period <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/Fire%20Insurance%20Maps/F_162_top.jpg">here</a> 
        shows Cain located east of Main near Clegg St.. By 1917 Cain was no longer 
        listed in the directory. </p>
      <p>There is more on John Graham <a href="../Notables/John%20Graham.htm">here</a>.<br>
      </p>
      The end of clay brick production in Ottawa East may have come about because 
      of the residential growth in the area. Both the O'Dell family and Cain probably 
      found it more profitable to sell the land for residential development rather 
      than make brick. Robert Sibbitt purchase most of Lot I in 1911 and subdivided 
      the land into Brantwood Place (see that story <a href="Brantwood%20Place.htm">here</a>). 
      Ottawa East did continue to manufacture brick however - not with clay but 
      instead sand and lime. </td>

    <td colspan="2">The location was ideal for several reasons. Silicate brick 
      is made from sand, lime and water that has been agglomerated (mixed), compacted 
      and cooked under pressure for several hours. This produces a very hard, 
      durable crystalline brick. The canal provided a ready supply of water and 
      transportation for the large quantity of sand required. The sand was obtained 
      from the &quot;Uplands Sand Pits&quot; located upstream near the present-day 
      Hunt Club Bridge. With the help of Col. By's canal system, barges were loaded 
      and sailed downstream to Mooney's Bay where they were locked down into the 
      canal. Many older residents of Ottawa East recall massive piles of sand 
      along the canal at the brickworks in the 1920's. The Fire Insurance Map 
      of that time period shows the detail of the plant and indicates that 44 
      men were employed. To see the map go <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/Fire%20Insurance%20Maps/F_162_btm.jpg">here</a>.</td>

      <a href="../Image%20Library/Canal/X_Canal_siding.jpg">here</a>. 
      <p>By the 1921 the company had become the Foster and Cram Company. Production 
        continued through the 1920's and by the early 1930's the company had moved 
        to another location. Given the federal government's penchant for beautifying 
        the canal lands it is a wonder that brick production by the canal lasted 
        that long. Today Echo Drive is situated on the brickwork's land.</p>
      <p>The closing of the silicate brick plant was the end of an era in Ottawa 
        East that began in the mid-1860's with the arrival of Horace O'Dell. It 
        was also the last time there was a large-scale industrial production in 
        the community. And finally, it marked the end of the canal's economic 
        usefulness to Ottawa East. The legacy lives on however, in that the millions 
        of bricks produced were used to build Ottawa.<br>
