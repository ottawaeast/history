    <td>Annexation of many suburbs in 1907 rekindled an interest in the residential 
      development of Ottawa East. As part of Mayor Ellis' vision of a &quot;Greater 
      Ottawa&quot;, the agricultural land between Main, Clegg and the Rideau River 
      was now viewed by developers as having future potential. 
      <p>In March of 1911, Robert A. Sibbitt and Nepean Realty Ltd. purchased 
        the majority of the land in Concession D, Lot I (Rideau Front) for $94,000. 
        Sibbitt's plan was to create a huge residential subdivision and market 
        the lots as &quot;a residential section for the discriminating and a boulevard 
        homesite for the particular&quot;. He named the neighbourhood &quot;Brantwood 
        Place&quot;.<br>

    <td colspan="2"> 
      <div align="left">The success of the concept was based entirely on the idea 
        that &quot;upscale&quot; homebuyers would be attracted to the lots by 
        aggressive marketing and the promise of future amenities such as a streetcar 
        line. That was a tall order given the near isolation of Ottawa East at 
        the time. While the swing bridge across the canal (just north of present-day 
        Pretoria Bridge) did provide a connection to the city, it could not support 
        the electric trolley from Elgin St. As well, questions about adequate 
        water, sewer and electrical services had to be answered. One can only 
        speculate how the problem of the annual spring flood was addressed. 
        <p>To answer these questions and promote Brantwood Place Sibbitt produced 
          the now-famous brochure (reproduced in part <a href="Sibbitt%20Brochure.htm">here</a>). 
          Approximately 10 by 7 inches with 4 colours, the elaborate document 
          contained numerous graphics, photographs and marketing text that bordered 
          on hyperbole. In it Sibbitt answered all of the questions with future 
          promises and characterized the surroundings as being ideal for the discriminating 
          purchaser. He described the brochure content as &quot;being the story 
          of an effort to please the fastidious&quot;.<br>

      <div align="left">The actual date of publication is not clear. The brochure 
        has several references to 1911 as well as the proposed &quot;high level&quot; 
        bridge over the canal at Bank St. There is also a mention of the proposed 
        bridge from Mutchmor (Fifth Ave.) to Clegg St. - an active topic in 1912. 
        There is no mention of Pretoria Bridge that was to be approved in 1914. 
        So with a wee bit of inductive thinking, a good guess for the date of 
        publication is circa 1912-13. The Plan of Subdivision was filed on December 
        6, 1913 (M45). 
        <p>Sibbitt's main answer to the &quot;heretofore impassible barrier of 
          the canal&quot; was the rebuilding of Bank St. Bridge that would extend 
          the streetcar services up Riverdale and Main. Until that time, he indicated 
          that &quot;it is even now but a 12 minutes walk from the end of either 
          Elgin Street or Bank Street car lines to the property - with granolithic 
          (cement) walks all the way up Main St.&quot;. He neglected to mention 
          that there was no snow removal for sidewalks, making it somewhat difficult 
          to trudge up Main in subzero weather.<br>

        specific restrictions</a> on sales were listed to ensure &quot;&quot;good

        of local field stone set in a concrete matrix, on top of concrete base, 
        filled with rubble and capped by &quot;stone balls&quot;. The brochure 
        suggests that an ornamental arch of ironwork was installed connecting 
        the inside pillars. Local legend has it that the arch was removed early 
        on as it became a hazard. As time has shown, Sibbitt was not concerned 
        with durability as the vagaries of weather and traffic have created problems 
        for the structures. There is much more on this story <a href="Stone%20Gates.htm">here</a>.</div>

      <div align="left">With all of his effort however, the anticipated interest 
        in Brantwood Place did not materialize. Notwithstanding the building of 
        Pretoria Bridge and the extension of public transport, sale of the lots 
        was very slow. The 1922 oblique air photo of Brantwood Place shows the 
        entrance gates at Beckwith with little else. Only a portion of Beckwith, 
        Marlowe and Clegg were constructed with just a few houses built. As the 
        sequence of air photos below demonstrates, Sibbitt's original vision was 
        not realized for many years. In the end, one of the most desirable neighbourhoods 
        in the region did emerge. With a beautiful beach that attracted thousands 
        on a hot summer's day, no commercial development and the later extension 
        of the community south of Elliot St., the community grew rapidly after 
        the Second World War. That story has been left to a future time.</div>
