      <p>Had the original developer of Brantwood, Robert Sibbitt, realized the 
        future importance of his pillars, he may have chosen better quality cement. 
        It appears that soon after construction the elaborate ironwork arch that 
        joined the inside pillars became unstable and was removed. By the 1940's, 
        with ground vibration from increased traffic and the odd whack by a snowplow, 
        the cement that formed the pillars began to crumble. A decision by the 
        city to remove the structures however was met with furious opposition 
        by Ottawa East residents.</p>
      <p>As the history of Ottawa East has shown time and time again, when confronted 
        with a problem the solution is usually arrived at by the creative thinking 
        of the residents. Led by respected long-time residents E. P. Nunn, Art 
        Humphries and many others, in 1949 residents negotiated with the city 
        to designate the gates as a war memorial. The dedication took place on 
        Remembrance Day of that year. It also marked a rare occasion when the 
        city actually listened to the people of Ottawa East. A much more complete 
        story of this topic can be found in the November 1989 Mainstreeter article 
        by Vicki Davis located <a href="../Mainstreeter/Stone%20Gates.htm">here</a>.

      <p>Today (2004) the Stone Gates are once again threatened - this time by 
        Mother Nature, frenetic snowplow operators and a tight city budget. The 
        Winter 2004 Mainstreeter article written by Pierre Johnson, President 
        of the Old Ottawa East Community Association, with help from Susan MacPhee, 
        Nancy Smith, Heather Moxsley and this writer, describes the present debate. 
        The article is found <a href="../Mainstreeter/Stone%20Gates%20-%20What%20is%20happening.htm">here</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>Given the present-day threat by Queensway expansion to the old town hall, 
        it is critical that the correct decision regarding the gates be made. 
        The silent sentinels that have stood since 1912 may soon be the only remaining 
        original landmarks on Main Street!</p>
