    <td>The annexation of Ottawa East in 1907 was a prelude to the creation by 
      the city of an industrial and waste complex at the end of Lees Avenue. As 
      detailed in Chapter Six, the city wanted this land to be the centre of future 
      commercial development that connected to the railways adjacent. Another 
      advantage of this location was the prevailing winds that blew from west 
      to east of the city proper. Any pungent odours would simply blow away from 
      the city. 
      <p>Within a decade a massive gasification plant, tar works, incinerator 
        and landfill had been established along Lees Ave. Coupled with the daily 
        discharge of the adjacent slaughterhouse into the river, this &quot;industrial 
        park&quot;&quot; soon became a major source of environmental contamination 
        which lingers even today.<br>
      </p>
      <b>The Ottawa Gas Works: </b> 
      <p>For nearly fifty years the tallest structure in Ottawa East was a massive 
        steel girder frame, about ten stories high. Situated at the end of Hawthorne 
        Ave. just east of Lees, this was the main storage tank for the coal gas 
        produced by the Ottawa Gas Company originally owned by the Ottawa Gas 
        and Electric Company. The plant complex was situated between the tank, 
        Lees and the railway lines.<br>

    <td>It has not been possible to establish the exact date when the complex 
      was built. The Intera Report of 1988 <font size="-1">(1)</font> indicated 
      that the plant operated &quot;from about 1920 to 1957&quot;. The 1922 Fire 
      Insurance Map (NMC 10837, 259) shows a plant configuration almost identical 
      to the 1956 Fire Insurance Map and the 1961 air photo. From these and other 
      sources <font size="-1">(2)</font> it appears that the plant was in full 
      production by 1920. 
      <p>From the early Nineteenth Century to the 1940's, gasifying coal or coke 
        produced almost all fuel gas distributed for residential and commercial 
        use. In the 1940's the availability of low-cost natural gas severely reduced 
        the market for manufactured gas. The Enbridge Gas Co. publication &quot;Tradition 
        of Service&quot; records a decline from an early customer base of 20,000 
        to 2,400 by 1957 when a natural gas supply arrived in Ottawa. This would 
        have been about the time the Lees Ave. plant was closed.<br>

    <td>&quot;Water gas&quot; as it is called, is made by reacting coal in a cyclical 
      process with air and steam in a vertical <a href="../Image%20Library/General/X_gasification_schematic.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/General/sm/X_gasification_schematic%20sm.jpg" width="200" height="126" align="right" border="0" alt="Modern version of the gasification process"></a>retort. 
      The coal is converted into combustible gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon 
      monoxide, hydrogen, methane and nitrogen. After purification, the gases 
      can be used as fuels or as material for chemical and fertilizer manufacture. 
      The process also produces by-products such as ammonia liquor, tar and ash. 
      The process was invented in 1873 and later enhanced with the addition of 
      oil to the reactor, which dramatically increased the thermal content of 
      the gas. This enhanced gas became the standard for residential and commercial 
      use. The diagram shown here is a modern version of the process. 
      <p>The Lees plant was ideally situated given the proximity to the rail lines. 
        Tons of coal arrived daily and were transferred to the plant via an &quot;electric 
        siding&quot; that ran the length of the plant. The rail line continued 
        across Lees Ave. to the tar works. In the original configuration coal 
        was piled under a steel crane that lifted the fuel into a 40-foot tall 
        coal shed where it was fed by gravity into the retort house. This building 
        appears on the 1922 map but was omitted on the 1956 version for some unknown 
        reason. The resultant gas was then piped through a condensation and purification 
        process to be finally stored in two tanks with 1,500,000 and 80,000 cubic 
        foot capacities. These tanks had a &quot;steel bladder&quot; that expanded 
        as the tanks filled hence the tall structure of steel girders used to 
        support the vessel. The tank also maintained the pressure necessary to 
        move the gas through pipes to the consumer. The by-products, such as ammonia 
        liquor and coal tar, were stored on underground tanks.<br>

      <p>The coal tar produced by gasification was piped across Lees Ave. to the 
        Hamilton Tar Products Company (later Currie Products Ltd.). This smaller 
        complex had a boiler house, tar still and storage tanks. The liquid was 
        refined here and distilled into tar products such as roofing material 
        and road tar. The finished product was shipped by truck locally and by 
        railway tanker car via the 400-foot spur connecting to the main line (see 
        map just above).</p>
      <p>When the gasification and tar works were closed in the late 1950's Ottawa 
        East was left with a sorry mess. Environmental awareness and laws were 
        still years away so the companies were not required to restore the site 
        to the original condition. In the 1980's the construction of the apartment 
        buildings and Transitway Station revealed large deposits of coal tar wastes. 
        This hazardous material contaminated groundwater and soil and was leaching 
        into the Rideau River. This discovery resulted in the construction of 
        a groundwater collection and treatment system at the station and cleanup 
        of the river. This system will have to be maintained as long as the Transitway 
        operates.<br>

    <td><b>The Garbage Incinerator: </b> 
      <p>Mayor J. E. Ellis' 1907 vision of a &quot;Greater Ottawa&quot; created 
        not only a great population but also a great pile of garbage. By the end 
        of the decade the City Fathers were confronted with a serious dilemma 
        regarding the disposal of waste. The logical solution was to burn the 
        material. Since Ottawa East was already designated as an industrial area 
        and accustomed to belching smoke from locomotives, it was a logical site 
        for an incinerator.</p>
      <p>On March 17, 1910 the city passed a motion (#5, p.191) to acquire the 
        property of the Wilson Estate. The site was located at the end of Lees 
        Ave. approximately where the Algonquin Campus was built (southern part 
        of Lot G, Concession D, 11 acres). Motion #8 (p.518) on September 29, 
        1910 awarded a contract for construction of the incinerator to the Laurie 
        and Lamb Company at a cost of $34,650. A &quot;Heenan-Froide Type Incinerator&quot; 
        was installed with a 75 ton per 24-hour capacity using a steam jet draft. 
        The specifications were designed to incinerate all &quot;refuse, garbage 
        and dead animals&quot;. The plant was to be built in 12 months.</p>
      <p>By 1912 the plant was in full operation and council recommended a bridge 
        be built over the railway tracks at Lees Ave. to &quot;shorten the haul 
        of scavenging&quot; (June 20, Motion #18, p.471). In 1914 the Board of 
        Health recommended that an abattoir (slaughterhouse) be built adjoining 
        the incinerator as the site was &quot;considered by experts to be admirably 
        situated&quot; (Nov. 16, Report 23, #13, p.471). A spur line from the 
        Grand Trunk Railway combined with trucking down Lees and Hurdman Avenues 
        would deliver the condemned beasts to a city-run facility where the carcasses 
        could be disposed of just next door. The city also proposed that a bylaw 
        be passed requiring that all meat be slaughtered at this site. This monopoly 
        would have been a &quot;cash cow&quot; for the city coffers. Thankfully 
        the abattoir was never built.</p>
      <p>The amazing 1922 oblique air photograph found <a href="../Image%20Library/Airphotos/OTT22_3000pix.jpg">here</a> 
        shows the incinerator in full production. Located to the far right of 
        the photo, across from the gas and tar works, a giant plume of smoke can 
        be seen rising into the atmosphere. The 1922 Fire Insurance Map clearly 
        identifies the location between Lees and the river (see a portion of the 
        map <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Incinerator.jpg">here</a>).<br>
        <br>
        The incinerator ceased operation around 1930. Perhaps city politicians 
        were overcome with a wave of environmental consciousness. It is more likely 
        that the plant could no longer handle the load of an increasing population. 
        But that was not a problem for the wise city council. The simple solution 
        was to bury the damn stuff. But where? </p>

    <td><b>The Garbage Dumps: </b> 
      <p>You guessed it! The solution was to truck the noxious material to a big 
        hole in Ottawa East. There was plenty of vacant land, good roads and liquid 
        that oozed out of the dump would simply be washed away by the river. Out 
        of sight - out of mind - excellent solution! Once again the community 
        was given the privilege of contributing to the vision of a &quot;Greater 
        Ottawa&quot;.</p>
      <p>The 1988 Intera Report that assessed former industrial sites shows three 
        garbage dumps (later referred to as landfill sites) in the Ottawa East 
        community. Greenfield Ave., Concord Street North and the railway tracks 
        bound the northern site (L36). This area was originally a low marshy area 
        with a major creek that drained into the river (an ideal location for 
        a garbage dump!). This area must have been used after 1907 because there 
        is no mention of it in the village minutes. No date has been found regarding 
        the closure of this site. The specific location is listed as Lot 6, Concession 
        D. From the map it appears to be the later location of the Morrison-Lamothe 
        Bakery vehicle yard.</p>
      <p>Two other garbage dumps (L12 and L28) were located south of Lees Ave. 
        between Chestnut Street and<img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Landfill%20crop.jpg" width="296" height="273" align="right" alt="Landfill Sites in St. George's Ward  (Ottawa East)"> 
        the railway lines at the river. From the scant information found to date 
        and as evidenced by the air photos, these dumps were used in the 1930's 
        and 40's. Again strategically located beside the river, this rotting material 
        was annually soaked by the spring floods that washed tons of contaminants 
        into the waterway. It is often said that this area has not been developed, 
        as much of the property is still owned by the federal government. Not 
        so! Landfill sites do not support heavy buildings and dangerous gases 
        such as methane can seep into subsurface structures. That's why only small, 
        one-story houses without basements were built in the Chestnut - Brunswick 
        Avenue area.</p>
      <p>By the end of the 1940's Ottawa East had run out of space for city garbage. 
        The city in all its wisdom solved the problem by simply moving the dump 
        across the river. As the panoramic picture <a href="../Image%20Library/Airphotos/X_36285_Gas_Tank_alongriver_new.jpg">here</a> 
        shows, the land at that time was almost entirely agricultural. The map 
        shows that the city created a massive site from near Hurdman Bridge to 
        Billings Bridge between the river and Riverside Drive. The good news is 
        that the area is now rolling parkland with a bicycle path that will never 
        be built upon. Look closely the next time you travel by the area and you 
        will see pipes sticking out of the larger hills. These are vents for the 
        gases still being produced in the rotting garbage just below the surface.</p>
      <p>The visible evidence of the industrialization of Ottawa East begun in 
        1907 has all but disappeared now. High-rise apartments, a college campus 
        and a bus station have replaced gas and tar works. New forest and meadow 
        now cover the remaining land. But a lasting legacy still lurks just beneath 
        the surface and it will be centuries before this material completely dissipates. 
        So much for Ellis' vision of a &quot;Greater Ottawa&quot;.<br>
