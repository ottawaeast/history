    <td>The sense of community that was felt in the village of Ottawa East at 
      the beginning of the Twentieth Century still persisted 50 years later. And 
      this spirit was manifest in a decidedly unique way - through a New Year's 
      Day football game called the &quot;Frost Bowl&quot;. 
      <p>The tradition of &quot;bowl&quot; games on the first day of the new year 
        had been established decades before in that country south of the border. 
        By the end of the 1940's, many Canadian cities decided that they needed 
        their own grid iron classic to bring in the new year. A fad was started. 
        The first bowl game in Ottawa was played at Brewer's Park in 1949. The 
        &quot;Snow Bowl&quot; pitted the Red Devils against the All Stars of the 
        &quot;Ottawa South League&quot;. The Devils won 6-0 that year. As reported 
        in the Ottawa Journal, this was to be &quot;Ottawa's own New Year's Annual&quot; 
        (it lasted until 1956, and was resurrected in later years).<br>
      </p>
      Not to be outdone, the lads in Ottawa East decided that their community 
      needed its own competition. On January 1, 1950 the &quot;First Annual Ottawa 
      East Frost Bowl&quot; was held at St. Patrick's College on Main St. There 
      are differing stories as to the genesis of the game but it is clear that 
      Ottawa East at this point had more than a fair share of excellent athletes. 
      As the names below reveal, the men (and boys) who played in this classic 
      were also involved in every sport in the Ottawa region. Chasing a pigskin 
      around a knee-deep field of snow in freezing cold weather with a hangover 
      was a logical extension to their usual athletic endeavours. It was just 
      more fun!</td>

    <td>The Ottawa Citizen described the 1950 teams as lacking &quot;trimming 
      and dressing up but nothing in enthusiasm . . . There was at least one football 
      helmet, possibly two of three sets of pads but the rest was strictly informal. 
      Toques, caps, parka hoods, parkas, sweaters from a number of clubs, gloves, 
      mitts, overshoes, galoshes, ski boots and basketball shoes all could be 
      picked out as the rival squads battled&quot;. 
      <p>The teams were based on street addresses. Those living north of Springhurst 
        formed Upper Ottawa East and those south of the line were the Lowers. 
        This boundary was later changed to Clegg St. for certain years. There 
        was always a debate about certain player's eligibility but in the end 
        nobody cared. Even the odd &quot;alien&quot; was permitted to play depending 
        on the particular New Year's Eve party he had attended.</p>
      <p>The score depended to a large extent on the field conditions. Knee-deep 
        snow usually meant a low score. January thaws meant more running and higher 
        scores but also more bruises and sopping wet clothes. Rules were similar 
        to normal football but with no &quot;white&quot; lines, enforcement was 
        at the pleasure of the referee. &quot;First and ten&quot; was paced off 
        by the ref' and he decided if the necessary yardage was achieved. For 
        those few who argued, they were told to shut up and play - by their own 
        teammates. The game was fun!<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the early days a touchdown was worth five points, a convert one and 
        a &quot;rouge&quot; was one point. Rouge, for those who don't remember, 
        was scored when a player was tackled in his own end zone (I think?). Early 
        articles list &quot;flying wings, middles and outsides&quot; for positions. 
        For a long time the teams were named the Upper and Lower Slobovians or 
        Slobs (Editor's Note: Yes, even grown men can be silly when having fun).</p>
      <p>In 1952, Sammy Dibartalo, who operated a local corner store, donated 
        a trophy for the winning team. The &quot;Most Valuable Player&quot; trophy 
        was donated in 1955 by Patsy Guzzo, Ottawa East's most famous athlete 
        of all time. There is more on his story <a href="../Mainstreeter/Patsy%20Guzzo.htm">here</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>The Frost Bowl was a major event in Ottawa East during the 1950's. Newspaper 
        accounts report crowds of over 400 people lining the hill next to the 
        field. By the 1960's there was less interest and younger brothers or even 
        sons largely replaced the original group of players. The tradition continued 
        and every January 1st, around one o'clock in the afternoon, motley dressed 
        males would be seen trudging their way to St. Pat's field - no matter 
        what the weather.<br>
      </p>
      The descriptions below covers the period from the beginning in 1950 to 1968 
      after which the newspaper reporting becomes inconsistent. The status of 
      the Frost Bowl after that year has been left for the next researcher. Highlights 
      of the scoring have been condensed from the newspaper articles and where 
      possible team rosters have been reproduced. The historical value of this 
      data may be debated by some but as Springsteen sings, those were the &quot;glory 
      days&quot; for many! This writer hopes that it will rekindle memories of 
      a time when it was just fun to play.</td>
