      <b><u> 
      <p>Overview of the Year:</p>
      </u></b> 
      <p>This was the year that the Village of Ottawa East began to change from 
        a sleepy little suburb with few services into a forward-looking corporation 
        sensitive to the demands of a modern community. Ratepayers continued to 
        demand drains and sidewalks but they also wanted the snow removed in the 
        winter and electric light at night. As the population had now grown significantly, 
        an additional school was needed. Council, with 3 new members, was now 
        being forced to deal with new regulations for such things as the sale 
        of liquor in the village. Concerns about health and fire protection spurred 
        the council to open negotiations with the City across the canal. It was 
        a time of change.</p>
      <p>Appointments included: William Doran to the Board of Health for 3 years; 
        A. Greenfield and Eugene Gingras (civil servant at 5 3<sup>rd</sup> St.) 
        as auditors @ $6 each; William H. Wright (carpenter at 103 Drummond St.) 
        as assessor for the year at $50; and W. A. Cole returned as tax collector 
        @ $50/year. Peter Becker (a butcher at 30 Centre St.) resigned as pound 
        keeper. </p>
      <p>The clerk received $7.80 for registering 17 births, 16 deaths and 6 marriages 
        @ 20 cents each. Charles Rhomheld was paid $4 for 14 street signs and 
        16 house signs.</p>
      <p>Local services and improvements were at the forefront this year. Council 
        now invested more money in snow cleaning. In February J.C. Ogilvie was 
        $11.13 for clearing snow with the help of his horse (rate of 25 cents/hour 
        for 44.5 hours). Michael Redmond worked 48.5 hours at 15 cents/hour clearing 
        snow for a total of $7.28. A snowplow was purchased from G. Roundean? 
        for $17. The plow was placed in the southern part of the village under 
        the control of Councilor George Patterson and was to be used only for 
        heavy snows. It had to be repaired by Wilfred Joly, a blacksmith at 97 
        Main St., in March at a cost of 85 cents.</p>
      <p>The Village still had no fire protection and the clerk was directed to 
        approach the City of Ottawa to investigate the possibility of receiving 
        city water. It was noted that there was some urgency as &quot;the season 
        when connection can be made across the canal is coming to a close&quot;. 
        It was February.</p>
      <p>Residents on Drummond St. petitioned for grading of the street and sidewalks. 
        R. Biggars, who had lost his Council seat by one vote was notified by 
        the clerk that he owed $14.46 for his share of the sidewalk extension 
        at his premises. Council formed a works committee to investigate the future 
        needs for roads, drains and sidewalks. R. B. Taylor was hired as a foreman 
        at 17.5 cents/hour to supervise future work along with an assistant at 
        15.5 cents/hour. George Stevens Sr. of Jones and Stevens at 32 4<sup>th</sup> 
        St. was paid $15.45 for mowing the village grass.</p>
      <p>A delegation of Public School Trustees approached Council in June seeking 
        $8,000 to build an additional school. A public meeting was held in June 
        to discuss the &quot;advisability&quot; of the idea. In July the clerk 
        was advised to notify the School Board that the cost was excessive. But 
        the ratepayers prevailed and in November a bylaw was drafted to authorize 
        a debenture for $8,000 to be paid over 30 years at 4.5%. On December 29 
        the bylaw was put to the voters and it was defeated.</p>
      <p>An application was made to County License Commission for a shop license 
        to sell liquor in the village by ----? Leclerc?. The village voted against 
        granting of this license. They also voted to raise the cost of a tavern 
        license in the village to $150. </p>

        Lumber Co. regarding an &quot;objectionable stench from a slaughterhouse 
        in their locality&quot; (William St.). It appears that there was some

      <p>A major event occurred in October when the Reeve was authorized to &quot;procure 
        figures for electric light&quot; for streets. There were several companies 
        in the area that could provide the electricity and the Council selected 
        the company that supplied the town hall. In December an agreement was 
        signed between the Village of Ottawa East and the Ottawa Electric Company 
        located at 35 Sparks St. The agreement came into force on January 12, 
        1903 with Bylaw #79. The schedule of rates and services no longer exists 
        but from later council minutes it is clear that the electric company supplied 
        the wiring and arc lights for the streets it serviced.</p>
      <p>The election for the new council of 1903 was held on Dec. 30 at noon 
        with the Village Clerk Walter N. Barry, (a foreman with Harris Campbell 
        and Boyden living at 14 7<sup>th</sup> St.), presiding. One Reeve and 
        four Councillors were elected. The number of School Trustees is unknown 
        at this time.</p>
