    <td>As prosperity began to return in the late 1870&#146;s the suburbs surrounding 
      the city continued to grow along with new demand for increased services. 
      The appeal of low taxes, few regulations and independence drew the working 
      class to the communities on the periphery of the city. Land was cheap and 
      most people were content initially to do without many of the services available 
      to city dwellers. Being annexed (joined) to the city was not something that 
      suburban residents desired. However, countervailing pressures from city 
      politicians, land speculators and the need to modernize began to emerge. 
      As a result a battle over annexation of the suburbs erupted. </td>

      Therefore urbanization issues inherent with an expanding population had 
      to be dealt with by a local government with a decidedly rural mindset and 
      strictly limited in power by the Municipal Act. Under this 1849 Act "it 
      was intended that subdivision planted in rural townships adjacent to Ontario 
      cities would secure urban services by seeking annexation to the urban municipalities. 
      " <b><font size="1">(1)</font></b>. While most suburbanites rejected this 
      form of solution, they increasingly demanded basic amenities such as fire, 
      police and public health protection. The demands began to dominate township

    <td>As discussed in a previous chapter, Nepean Council was, for the most part, 
      reactive in dealing with ratepayer&#146;s requests. In turn both rural and 
      urban residents did not make excessive demands in order to keep taxes low. 
      But this arrangement had difficulty dealing with the growing pressures of 
      new urban functions and numerous external forces. Ultimately changes were 
      made that affected both the suburban and rural residents of the township. 
      <p><b><u>The Forces Driving Annexation</u></b></p>
      <p>The solution to the problem of meeting the growing urban needs appeared 
        to many, both in the township and the city, to be annexation. And the 
        ultimate decision as to whether or not this would occur was the responsibility 
        of the province. As with the modern-day amalgamation of the Ottawa Region, 
        the decisions of this nature are not democratic &#150; they are imposed! 
      </p>
      <p>Leading the fight for annexation were the city (hoping to increase the 
        tax base), landowners (who anticipated a raise in land values) and affluent 
        suburban residents who wanted the amenities of public<a href="../Image%20Library/People/PA132253.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/People/sm/PA132253%20sm.jpg" width="179" height="118" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="3" border="0" alt="Maggie Hyde at pump - 29 Main St. - 1899"></a> 
        safety and clean water. The argument was that in joining with the city, 
        the suburbs would enjoy advantages not available in a rural setting but 
        necessary for any modern community. Suburbanites were immediately suspicious 
        of this claim and many remained steadfast in opposition to annexation.</p>
      <p>Of paramount importance in the debate was the subject of services &#150; 
        their provision and cost. In Nepean, taxes were levied on all residents 
        for any services in any area. Rural residents were therefore reluctant 
        about paying higher taxes for needed improvements in the urban areas from 
        which they would not derive benefit. Moreover, the township was limited 
        by the Municipal Act as to the type of services that could be provided. 
      </p>
      <p>By contrast Bytown, which had separated from Nepean in 1850, was not 
        constricted in this way. Immediately after separation the city changed 
        the process of statute labour to "a road-works rate" <b><font size="1">(2)</font></b>. 
        In 1851 equipment was provided for several volunteer fire departments 
        . . . a salaried police department was started in 1866 . . . a professional 
        fire department in 1874". Private companies initiated other amenities 
        such as "gas lighting in 1854 . . . a horse tramline in 1870 . . . electric 
        lights in 1885 . . . electric street lights in 1890 . . . and telephone 
        services for city and suburbs in the 1870&#146;s" <b><font size="1">(3)</font></b>.</p>
      <p>The issue of public health was a major point put forward by the pro-annexationists 
        "as urban congestion and urban filth began driving up death rates, chiefly 
        from infant mortality and contagious disease "<b><font size="1">(4)</font></b>. 
        The imaginary lines of municipal boundaries did not deter the threat of 
        disease. What affected one community could spread to all.</p>
      <p>Smallpox for example "was a recurring problem in the working class areas" 
        <font size="1"><b>(5)</b></font> such as Archville. The use of pit privies 
        (outhouses) in residential areas had the potential of contaminating the 
        groundwater reserve. Since most homeowners used a backyard or public well 
        as the source for their potable water, the threat of contamination and 
        the spread of disease was always present. Even the water from rivers was 
        contaminated by sources such as tanneries and slaughterhouses. Regarding 
        the latter, the 1875 Report from the City of Ottawa Medical Health Officer 
        (MHO) noted that </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&nbsp;<i>" . . . all . . . are constructed of wood, and unprovided 
          with trough, gutter or reservoir of any kind. In utter violation of 
          public rights, they have openings in the floor, or slides, through which 
          blood, offal (trimmings), and fecal matter are covertly dropped into 
          the water of the Rideau River. The latter is largely used in the neighbourhood 
          for domestic purposes and hence the supplies of ice for summer use in 
          the city are mostly drawn" </i><font size="1"><b>(6)</b></font>. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p> There were no adequate mechanisms for cleaning properties, privy vaults 
        or the roads; and no public dumps. Even control of the dumping of night 
        soil (human waste) by private contractors presented a problem. A contractor 
        employed privately in the city to remove this material simply crossed 
        into the suburbs to dump the load where there was no authority to preclude 
        such activities.</p>
      <p>The MHO&#146;s 1875 report describes <i>"large quantities of household 
        refuse and garbage . . . thrown upon the thoroughfares" and pools of stagnant 
        water often filled with "decaying animal and vegetable matter and filth"</i> 
        <font size="1"><b>(7)</b></font>. This report pertained to the City of 
        Ottawa but there is every reason to believe that the situation was similar 
        in Ottawa East given the large number of butchers, slaughterhouses, tanneries and 
        the absence of any police or health inspector.</p>
      <p>The province passed a new Public Health Act in 1884 <b><font size="1">(8)</font></b> 
        requiring municipalities (including townships) to<img src="../Image%20Library/Documents/sm/D_Board_Health_logo.jpg" width="123" height="122" align="right" alt="Ontario Board of Health Logo"> 
        appoint a board of health to deal with these problems. Nepean complied 
        and appointed several officials including McLeod Stewart to deal with 
        the health issues in both the rural and urban areas. Without an adequate 
        law enforcement system, policing these new regulations was problematic 
        at best.</p>
      <p>Nepean Township had no authority over law enforcement, as this was the 
        responsibility of the County Council. Constables were appointed to deal 
        with matters in all the townships of Carleton County and enforcement in 
        urban areas was far from adequate. In the city, the work of the small 
        police department involved mostly "arrests for drunkenness, fighting and 
        prostitution" <b><font size="1">(9)</font></b>. City police were also 
        responsible for such mundane tasks as leasing stalls in the market, acting 
        as truant officers and ensuring the humane treatment of animals including 
        " "relieving" cows by milking them" <b><font size="1">(10)</font></b>. 
        Under supervision of the MHO they enforced sanitation by inspecting and 
        ordering the cleanup of city yards. Other duties included property protection, 
        the enforcement of building regulations and lending assistance to fire 
        fighters at all fires. Compare this to the suburban communities where 
        there was very little if any police activity.</p>
      <p>Fire protection was also used a carrot to entice suburbanites to support 
        annexation. By the 1870&#146;s the city <a href="../Image%20Library/General/CA%203491.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/General/sm/CA%203491%20sm.jpg" width="161" height="129" align="left" alt="Early rendition of a fire reel" border="0" vspace="3" hspace="3"></a>had 
        a professional fire service and with newly installed water mains, there 
        was a semblance of protection. But in the suburbs little could be done 
        to save life or property. In Stewarton, literally across the street (Gladstone) 
        from Ottawa, incidents occurred where the city fire department refused 
        to cross the city boundary and buildings perished. <b><font size="1">(11)</font></b>.</p>
      <p>But all of these services, from health to police and fire protection, 
        came with a price tag and the city had accrued a large debt. This was 
        a major impediment for the pro-annexationists. Many city dwellers felt 
        that the suburbanites, who worked in the city, benefited from the improvements 
        but did not share the cost. Moreover the populous suburbs drained away 
        potential taxpayers to a cheaper area. The counter argument offered by 
        many Nepean residents indicated that annexation was a tax grab to increase 
        the city&#146;s revenue, which had been seriously limited in the depression 
        of the 1870&#146;s. And they balked at being forced to assume additional 
        debt for "which they had no voice in creating and for improvements which 
        they derive no benefit" <b><font size="1">(12)</font></b>. <b><u> </u></b></p>
      <p><b><u>1882 - Annexation is proposed</u></b></p>
      <p>By 1882, the battle over annexation reached a crisis point. Ottawa City 
        Council, although seriously divided on the issue, indicated that application 
        would be made to the Ontario legislature. The pro-annexationists were 
        led by C. R. Cunningham who recommended that the city annex over 2000 
        acres of the suburbs (including Archville) and add 4,500 people to the 
        city tax rolls <b><font size="1">(13)</font></b>.</p>
      <p>Opposition to this move was swift and strenuous. Led by MPP G. W. Monk 
        (Monk St.) representing Nepean and supported by numerous petitions from 
        suburbanites including one "signed by all but 2 of the 98 resident householders 
        in Archville <font size="1"><b>(14)</b></font>", the debate in the private 
        bills committee of the assembly resulted in defeat of the city&#146;s 
        application. The Ottawa East petition was presented on January 22, 1883. 
        The actual motion with more information can be <a href="Petition_1883.htm">seen 
        here</a>. A later motion in City Council to reapply was also narrowly 
        defeated. </p>
      <p>Defeat did not still the debate and in 1887 the topic was raised again. 
        But this time the desire to join the city came from an influential group 
        of Stewarton residents. (<a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Suburbs_taylor_new.jpg">See 
        Map</a>)</p>
      <p>By the latter part of the decade, many of the affluent residents of this 
        suburb were no longer satisfied by the benefit of low taxes and the resultant 
        few services. Some Stewarton residents had already been hooked up to city 
        water and in one case of fire, the city brigade had come to the rescue. 
        The community was predominantly composed of "civil servants, engineers, 
        bookkeepers and respectable tradesmen (living) on Ann Street (Gladstone 
        Ave.) near Metcalfe. On McLeod and Argyle and their cross-streets were 
        the impressive late Victorian residences of senior bureaucrats, merchants, 
        gentlemen, and politicians" <b><font size="1">(15)</font></b>. This class 
        of people wanted more than the blue-collar workers of other suburbs and 
        they could afford to pay for these amenities. </p>
      <p>Early in 1877, this group petitioned the City for consideration. A similar 
        petition quickly followed their action from a group of Rochesterville 
        residents. The city struck a committee to consider the appeals and the 
        annexation battle rekindled.</p>
      <p>The debate raged throughout the remainder of 1887 into 1888. Anti-annexationists 
        claimed that: crushing taxes would oppress the poor; city water was "rotten"; 
        and that the city could not adequately service the streets it already 
        had. Counter-petitions were circulated amidst charges of political skulduggery 
        on both sides of the issue. One petition organized by James Hickey from 
        the market gardeners south of Stewarton protested that there were only 
        209 people in 43 dwellings on 600 acres <b><font size="1">(16)</font></b>, 
        with no streets or prospects for the extension of city services. They 
        argued that tax assessment as an urban area would be unfair.</p>
      <p>Despite all the opposition, the pro-annexationists won the day. The provincial 
        assembly passed the requested bill into law on March 23, 1888 with annexation 
        to be effective as of January 1, 1889 <b><font size="1">(17)</font></b>. 
        With minor alteration to accommodate assessment for agricultural land, 
        the suburbs of Stewarton, Rochesterville, Mount Sherwood and Orangeville, 
        just over 1,000 acres, were joined to the city. (<a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Suburbs_taylor_new.jpg">See

      <p><b><u><font size="4">*</font> &quot;Pro Libertate - For Freedom&quot; 
        </u></b></p>
      <p>But what happened to Archville and other parts of Ottawa East during 
        this furore? Why was this community not swallowed up with the others? 
        The answer to these questions reveals the true story of the birth of Ottawa 
        East Village.</p>
      <p>Amidst all the political intrigue of annexation, a tight little band 
        of Ottawa East stalwarts pulled off an &#145;end run&#146;. Faced with 
        the ravenous jaws of a subsuming city clique across the canal and an assured 
        annexation imposed by an insensitive provincial government, the small 
        cohesive community unleashed their secret weapon &#150; Robert Lees.</p>
      <p>Now this man has been mentioned in previous chapters and <u><a href="../../notables.htm">a 
        biography is available here</a></u>, but it is <a href="../Image%20Library/People/X_Lees_Robert_1878.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/People/sm/X_Lees_Robert_1878_sm.jpg" width="150" height="173" align="right" alt="Robert Lees 1878 - from the Belden Atlas" border="0" vspace="3" hspace="3"></a>necessary 
        at this point in the story to understand how critical he was to the creation 
        of the Ottawa East community.</p>
      <p>Lees had a vision for the evolution of the Ottawa East area. He had built his 
        home, Wildwood, in a forested area that offered his family a refuge from 
        the negative aspects of &#145;city life&#146;. Lees purchased large tracts 
        of land surrounding his home where he operated a profitable farm and orchards. 
        To a large extent his family <a href="../Image%20Library/Buildings/X_Wildwood_Orchard%20new.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Buildings/sm/X_Wildwood_Orchard%20sm.jpg" width="175" height="122" align="left" alt="Wildwood - Home of Robert Lees" border="0"></a>was 
        self-sufficient and did not require the amenities of the city. As a Crown 
        Attorney and Queen&#146;s Counsel, he journeyed to the court in Lower 
        Town on the Canal Road regularly to earn part of his livelihood. He preferred 
        life that way &#150; connecting to the city only when it was necessary. 
        But with forced annexation, control over his idyllic lifestyle and the 
        future evolution of his community would be lost to the interests of a 
        large city. The dilemma was how could this be avoided?</p>
      <p>Lees knew that the tiny community had little chance of stemming the political 
        tide that was washing over the area. A different approach was needed. 
        In early December of 1888, about a month before annexation was to take 
        place, Lees "petitioned Carleton County Council for a bylaw to incorporate 
        as an independent village" <b><font size="1">(18)</font></b>. As a prominent 
        citizen, owner of a large tract of land and well connected in political 
        circles, he held some sway at County Council.</p>
      <p>Critical to his argument for a village was the proximity of Col. By&#146;s 
        convenient canal. Lees used the obvious isolation from the city as a cornerstone 
        in his appeal. He noted that the community was distinct from the surrounding 
        city and suburbs as it was bounded by the Rideau river and the Canal and 
        in reality, only connected with Nepean Township via a narrow "tongue of 
        farmland" in the south. The residents of Ottawa East, it was explained, were of 
        the unanimous opinion that they could best acquire needed services and 
        management using their own local resources. All that was need was incorporation 
        as a village.</p>
      <p>The majority of County Council agreed, with the proviso that for the 
        community to be a village, it must have the "statutory population requirement 
        of 750 <b><font size="1">(19)</font></b>. This was confirmed by a member 
        of Council deputized to examine the number of residents. An examination 
        today however, of the original assessment record, shows something different. 
        <a href="../Databases/Nepean%20Township%20Assessment%201888%20New.htm">Go 
        here for a discussion on this topic</a>. </p>
      <p>After an opposing motion to defer the vote for legal opinion was defeated, 
        the bylaw was passed. So on December 7, 1888, just a few weeks before 
        annexation was to be imposed on the suburbs, the Village of Ottawa East 
        was born!</p>

      <p>The County Council Bylaw #348 which established the boundaries of the 
        Village of Ottawa East can be seen <a href="County_Council_Bylaw_348.htm">here</a>.</p>
      <p>For the next two decades the community had nearly complete control of 
        its evolution. Led by such notables as Lees, Ballantyne, Stewart and Graham, 
        the community grew and thrived as will be described in the next chapter.</p>
      <p><b><u>A final Note</u></b></p>
      <p>Perhaps the role of Robert Lees in the birth of Ottawa East Village has 
        been somewhat dramatized here. Certainly there were others it should be 
        recognized, who made valuable contributions in the fight for independence. 
        But from all the sources researched to date, it is clear that Lees led 
        the fight. Along with all his legal, agricultural, community, church and 
        family activities, he must have been an excellent chess player!</p>

        was pulled and an alarm sent. Fire fighters upon reaching the city line

        the house to burn down<br>
