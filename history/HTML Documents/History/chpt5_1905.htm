      <p><u><b>Appointments</b></u>:</p>
      <p>Again Arthur G. Greenfield and C. R. Robertson (by the Reeve) were appointed 
        auditors for a fee of $10 each. Hial (sic) W. Brooks, who worked in a 
        dairy and lived at 166 East Ave., was appointed to the Board of Health 
        for 3 years. He was also appointed Assessor for the year at $65/year with 
        the requisite $500 bond. A. Greenfield and Adolph Herbst? were also appointed 
        to the BoH for 3 years. Again William Cole was appointed as Tax Collector 
        in September at $65/year with the standard $500 bond. A. Acres served 
        as treasurer at $50 for the year. Newton J. Ker was appointed engineer 
        for the sewer project and W. Higgins was appointed Inspector of Drains.</p>
      <b></b> 
      <p><u><b>Communications</b></u>: </p>
      <p>Letters sent and received for the year included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>clerk was instructed to write to J. A. Robertson, the Secretary of 
          Fire Underwriters Association regarding a reduction in insurance;</li>
        <li>the Ottawa Electric Co. wrote to complain about street lights being 
          broken. Council directed the constable to investigate;</li>
        <li>residents on East Ave. complained about a dump and the concern was 
          referred to the BoH.</li>
        <li>the Public School Board requested $10,000 to build a new school.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There were no other references to communication in the minutes for the 
        entire year!</p>
      <b></b> 
      <p><u><b>Public Works</b></u>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the snow clearing account increased again this year. In January, 34 
          men and boys were employed at rates ranging from 8 cents to 15 cents/hour. 
          This involved 370 hours of work at a cost of $53.30. James Beaton and 
          W. Joly were paid $31.10 and $32.00 respectively for snow plowing;</li>
        <li>the idea to install a fire alarm system for the village was put on 
          hold;</li>
        <li>repair of Hurdman Rd. was to cost $300;</li>
        <li>Councillor Beaton was to direct the location of all gulley grates;</li>
        <li>the Ottawa Electric Co. was directed to place 5 lights on Hurdman 
          Rd. and 2 on East Ave.;</li>
        <li>tenders were received for the painting of the fire hall. The tenders 
          included:</li>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>W. Rhomhild -&#9;3 coats outside&#9;&#9;2 coats of oil inside&#9;$25 
            (accepted)<br>

            Fred Winges&#9;&#9; &quot;&#9;&#9; &quot;&#9;&#9;$30 </p>
        </blockquote>
        <li>William Rhomhild, a painter living at 7 Ella St. at $50/year, again 
          filled the position of village constable. Analysis of the village accounts 
          show that he was an industrious lad. His constabulary duties included: 
          collecting dog taxes at 10% of the total collected; health inspections 
          and burying carcasses; fumigating houses; and putting up street signs. 
          In addition he was also paid for painting the fire hall; snow clearing 
          and general labour. An interesting receipt regarding William can be 
          seen <a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_Receipt_1905_Romhild_new.jpg">here</a>;</li>
        <li>the clerk was paid $10.40 for registering births, deaths and marriages 
          and $4.25 for registering bylaws.</li>
      </ul>
      <b></b> 
      <p><u><b>Roads, drains, sewers, sidewalks and more</b></u>:</p>
      <p>Petitions included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grey Nuns requested a drain on Gordon St. &#150; the village paid 
          half of the cost;</li>
        <li>Ratepayers on 5<sup>th</sup> St. requested a drain &#150; tenders 
          to be called;</li>
        <li>There were numerous petitions for drains covered by a bylaw passed 
          on Nov. 29. The bylaw listed all the petitions to date that required 
          the building of drains. For approval each petition required that &quot;two-thirds 
          of the owners of the drain area approved and that this represent one-half 
          of the value of the real property to be benefited by the sewers&quot;. 
          These petitions included:</li>
      </ul>
      <dir> 
        <p>#1 &#150; C. F. Winter et al &#150; 7<sup>th</sup> St. &#150; from 
          eastern limit of lot 8 to main sewer on Main St.;</p>
        <p>#2 &#150; R. Pettapiece et al &#150; William St. &#150; 40 ft. west 
          of lot 5 to main sewer;</p>
        <p>#3 &#150; J. H. Roberts &#150; 6<sup>th</sup> St. &#150; lot 7 to Main 
          St;</p>
        <p>#4 &#150; J.B. St. Laurent &#150; 5<sup>th</sup> St. &#150; lot 9 to 
          Main St.;</p>
        <p>#5 &#150; R. J. Biggars et al 4<sup>th</sup> St. and Center St. to 
          main sewer on 2<sup>nd</sup> St.;</p>
        <p>#6 &#150; T. Ballantyne &#150; East Ave. &#150; Cedar St. to Main St. 
          at corner of 2<sup>nd</sup> St.;</p>

        <p>#8 &#150; H. Heney &#150; East Ave. from north of lot 1 on G to Patterson 
          property;</p>
        <p>#9 &#150; W. Doran &#150; Bronson St. &#150; involved Gordon, Drummond, 
          Clegg and McGillvray Streets.</p>
        <p>It is interesting to note that the lead people in all these petitions 
          were at one time on council or leaders in the community.</p>
      </dir>
      <ul>
        <li>tenders were received for the 5<sup>th</sup> St. drain. These included:</li>
      </ul>
      <dir> 
        <dir> P. Burns &#150; 3.5 cents/foot - $30/manhole;<br>
          H. Mentzel &#150; 3.5 cents/foot &#150; not pipe and covers - $25/manholes;<br>
          W. Higgins &#150; 3 cents/foot - &quot; - $24/ &quot; (accepted) </dir>

      <p><u><b>Waterworks</b></u>:</p>
      <b></b> 
      <ul>
        <u><b> </b></u> 
        <li>the Ottawa East Water Co. requested permission to use a small portion 
          of allowance near the Rideau River to erect a small house for waterworks 
          purposes with the promise to return the land when it was need;</li>
        <li>the Water Co. asked council to notify the city that no water could 
          be supplied to the village without a license. This request was probably 
          the result of water pipe being extended across the canal near the south 
          of the village to service Rideau Garden. This would have reduced the 
          monopoly enjoyed by the company;</li>
        <li>the village paid the water company $375 in December for services;<a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_Agreement_Electric_1905_new.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Documents/sm/D_Agreement_Electric_1905sm.jpg" width="150" height="66" align="right" alt="The 1905 Agreement with the Village" border="0"></a></li>
        <li>An agreement was signed with the Ottawa Electric Company to supply 
          power to the pumping station. Part of that agreement is shown below.</li>

      <b></b> 
      <center>
      </center>
      <p><u><b>Board of Health</b></u>:</p>
      <p>There were no motions or accounts recorded during this year.</p>
      <b></b> 
      <p><u><b>Council Motions, Policies and Bylaws</b></u>:</p>
      <p>Some examples of council&#146;s concerns include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the Reeve was authorized to borrow $3,000 from the Bank of Ottawa;</li>
        <li>Scott and Curle? were paid $15 for the Farrell case &#150; (the previous 
          year&#146;s civil suit?);</li>
        <li>Councillor Beaton was to engage all snow clearing labour in future;</li>
        <li>a bylaw was passed to prevent people from driving on sidewalks - $5 
          to $20 fine;</li>
        <li>a committee was formed to investigate the placement of planing mills 
          and grounds in the village so that they would not constitute a fire 
          hazard;</li>
        <li>a bylaw was passed giving the Fire Chief and his assistant the authority 
          to give orders at all fires and public functions such as parades and 
          drills of the Ottawa East Fire Brigade. Penalties included fines from 
          $2 to $10. (Ed. Note: Was this a power struggle in the village?);</li>
        <li>Reeve was authorized to borrow another $9,000 for current expenses;</li>
        <li>the clerk was authorized to send a petition to the Railway Commission 
          requesting that a crossing be built over the tracks at William St. at 
          the railway's cost. (Ed. Note &#150; this was an ongoing battle with 
          the railways. The tracks cut off a sizeable portion of the village to 
          the east).</li>
      </ul>
      <b></b> 
      <p><u><b>Court of Revision</b></u>:</p>
      <p>The Court of Revision was exceptionally busy this year. This was probably 
        due to the increase in taxes as a result of the sewer project. As well 
        there were numerous changes in the designation of school supporters from 
        public to separate. This was probably the result of the special debenture 
        to build the separate school and this board wanted to make sure it received 
        all the money due. The Court of Revision was held with a jury that was 
        selected from ratepayers who reviewed appeals from individual ratepayers 
        regarding their tax assessment or school support designation. </p>
      <p>As was the case in most years the larger commercial organizations appealed 
        their assessments as being excessive. The Ottawa and New York Railway 
        was assessed $1,000 and this was referred to another Court of Revision 
        held later. The Canada Atlantic Railway had the assessment reduced to 
        $80.000 at this session. Numerous large landowners such as Patterson, 
        Lees and Slattery had large portions of their holding reduced. A number 
        of separate school supporters had their assessments reduced as well. Judge 
        O&#146;Mara on July 26 held a special Court (for a fee of $5.50) where 
        certain properties were deemed to be assessable.</p>
      <p>The property mill rates and resultant payments for the year were as follows:</p>

      <p><u><b>Accounts</b></u>:</p>
      <p>Some of the more interesting accounts paid in this year included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>purchase from the Ottawa Fire Proof Co. of 500 feet of hose, 1 nozzle, 
          3 pairs of rubber boots and 3 rubber coats;</li>
        <li>H. St. Jean, Oscar Landriau and H. W. Brooks were each paid $2 for 
          use of horses at fires;</li>
        <li>the Ottawa Electric Co. was paid $193.60 for light for the village 
          streets for the year. The actual bill can be seen <a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_Receipt_1905_Electric.jpg">here</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The election for the 1906 council and school trustees was held on December 
        22, 1905. It should be noted that the ex-Reeve Henry Roche was nominated 
        for the position once again but the clerk declared him to ineligible for 
        the position. No reason was given but it may have had something to do 
        with his involvement with County Council &#150; perhaps he had not resigned 
        in time? John P. Cain, president of the Cain Brick Company at 162 Main 
        St. was elected as a Councillor for the first time. This is interesting 
        in that he is listed in the directory as living in Ottawa. Obviously residency 
        in the village was not a prerequisite for election, only ownership of 
        a business or land was needed. Cain became an important force in 1907 
        with the advent of amalgamation.</p>
      <p>And for the first time in the history of the village two separate election 
        polls were needed to accommodate the larger population. </p>
