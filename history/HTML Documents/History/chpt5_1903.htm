      <p>Overview of the Year:</p>
      </u></b> 
      <p>In the year of our Lord One Thousand Nine Hundred and Three, in the flourishing 
        Village of Ottawa East, it finally became illegal to wash the naked body 
        &quot;within sight of a public highway&quot;. This regulation, as well 
        as many others, was established during a momentous year as Council guided 
        the community into the modern age. Not only did the Village Fathers make 
        bold new moves to protect the morality of their citizens but also finally 
        established and enacted plans to solve the problems of drainage, sewage 
        disposal and a waterworks system.</p>
      <p>Under the leadership of a new Reeve, Ronald M. Saunders, a mason living 
        at 15 William St., bold initiatives were undertaken to provide the community 
        with the basic urban amenities available just across the Rideau Canal 
        in the City. Previous negotiations with the City for water had not been 
        successful so the villagers did what they almost always did &#150; they 
        built the amenities themselves. </p>
      <p>Before the Board of Health would approve a waterworks, the problems of 
        surface water drainage and sewage disposal had to be dealt with in an 
        acceptable manner. This meant that an engineer had to be hired, plans 
        drawn, the necessary permissions to cross private land obtained and then 
        a very large debenture, by way of a bylaw, had to be passed. All of this 
        was accomplished during 1903!</p>
      <p>The waterworks was a slightly different problem in terms of capitalization. 
        The village simply could not afford both a sewer and water system. Up 
        stepped several prominent ratepayers, most of whom had served on previous 
        councils, to offer an Ottawa East-style solution. They proposed the formation 
        of a private company to supply the pipe, pumping system and the water 
        if the council agreed to a somewhat creative partnership. After much negotiation 
        and political manoeuvring, council agreed and the Ottawa East Water Company 
        came into being.</p>
      <p>Bylaw #90, passed in December of 1903, firmly established the moral character 
        of the village. Not only did it become illegal to wash private parts in 
        public places, but a resident was now in serious danger of having to do 
        hard labour if he left his dead cow on the river bank; or operated a house 
        of ill fame; or exposed wounds or deformities for the purpose of gaining 
        alms. The village had come of age!</p>
      <p>The economy of the village must have received a major boost with all 
        of the work being done for the sewer and water systems. The accounts also 
        show a pronounced increase in expenditures. And the population was growing 
        as evidenced by the first-ever Registered Plan of Subdivision submitted 
        to the council. </p>
      <p>The first meeting of the new council was held on January 9. The retiring 
        Reeve, Henry Roche, was thanked for his dedicated service to the community 
        over the years and he was wished well in his new post as a County Councillor.</p>
      <p>The usual appointments were made including: Samuel Pearpoint to the Board 
        of Health for 3 years; Arthur Greenfield as an auditor; Michael Redmond 
        replaced Albert Tubbe (a mason living at 96 Bronson St.) for his term 
        on the B of H; and William A. Cole was once again the collector @ $50/yr. 
        with a $500 bond.</p>
      <p>John Tatman resigned as the village constable and the application of 
        William Rhomhild, a painter living at 4 Ella St. was accepted. A bylaw 
        was passed giving the constable the duties of Sanitary Inspector at $10/year. 
        He received the usual 10% of dog licenses collected ($9.80 as of June 
        1) and as per Bylaw #7, he received the costs for court duty and prosecuting 
        those guilty of such offences as allowing their cattle to run at large. 
        He was also appointed to the position of Pound Keeper later in the year 
        as Peter Becker, a butcher at 30 Centre St. had resigned. The salary for 
        the constable&#146;s duties was $50/year. The accounts also reveal that 
        3 special constables (Andrew Becker, P. O&#146;Donnell and Gustave Metzger) 
        were employed at $1.50 each. The reason for this is unknown.</p>
      <p>Motions at council included: meetings were now held on the first Monday 
        of each month; a Works Committee was formed to oversee roads, walks, ditches, 
        weed cutting and road obstructions; all collection of dog and bitch taxes 
        was to completed before June 1 as per Bylaw #3; Edward Lussier, a barber 
        at 22 Main St., was denied a pool hall license; and the clerks salary 
        was increased to $110 for the year.</p>
      <p>Council reviewed and passed a Plan of Subdivision on part of Lot G, Concession 
        C, owned by Margaret O&#146;Gara, widow of Martin the famous magistrate, 
        living at 33 Main St. This was land which is now the location of Wesley 
        United Church. Council also made an exchange with the estate of the late 
        George Patterson (Patterson&#146;s Field where St. Pat&#146;s College 
        was built). In exchange for the right to lay sewer pipe on the property 
        the village agreed to accept all streets in a future subdivision of the 
        land running from East Ave. to Main St. at a width of 50 feet. This would 
        have allowed for more housing lots but the subdivision never took place.</p>
      <p>The Board of Health accounts reveal that Dr. Birkett?, the Medical Health 
        Officer for the Village was paid $91.50 for his services to date. The 
        Ottawa Isolation Hospital was paid $20.07 for the case of N. McGuigan?, 
        and $42 was paid to Dr. Baptie?, the previous MHO.</p>

      <p>Compared to previous years there were fewer petitions for drains and 
        sidewalks. This may be due to the establishment of a Works Committee and 
        the impending sewer project. Council minutes show the following: Robinson 
        Ave. residents wanted improvement to the street; and residents on 6<sup>th</sup> 
        St. wanted a drain. Bernard Slattery, a butcher at 245 Main St. appealed 
        to council for improvement of the canal front on the south side. The council 
        agree to approach the Chairman of the Ottawa Improvement Commission (later 
        the National Capital Commission) with the aim of having the federal government 
        beautify the south side of the canal.</p>
      <b><u> 
      <p>Sewers . . . finally!</p>
      </u></b> 
      <p>By 1903, with an expanded population and numerous small industries, the 
        council was forced to deal with the ever-present problems of drainage 
        and sewage disposal. The use of pit privies (outhouses) and open ditches 
        for drainage and sewage were no longer adequate. In addition many residents 
        kept horses, cattle, pigs, chickens and dogs, all of which produced an 
        inordinate amount of manure. The risk of contaminating the ground water 
        reserve increased each year and so did the risk of spreading disease since 
        most residents used backyard wells.</p>
      <p>The solution was to build a main sewer line through the village, to which 
        each residence and business would connect, and then pipe the offensive 
        waste &#145;elsewhere&#146;. Elsewhere was located just offshore of the 
        banks of the Rideau River (where Springhurst Ave. now meets the river)! 
        While this solution may be deemed criminal by today&#146;s standards of 
        sanitation, in 1903 this practice was the usual answer for municipalities. 
        In fact it continues today &#150; ever visit Halifax?</p>
      <p>In February a deputation led by William Lees (a lawyer living at 28 William 
        St. and the son of the late Robert Lees) approached council with an offer 
        to construct and operate a village waterworks. It was decided to hold 
        a special meeting on Feb.10 to discuss the matter. At that meeting a special 
        subcommittee was formed to investigate the waterworks proposal and hire 
        an engineer to obtain an estimate for a sewer system since the Board of 
        Health would not agree to a waterworks unless the sewage problem was solved 
        first.</p>
      <p>Engineer Robert Surtees was employed and he delivered an estimate of 
        the sewer project to council on Feb. 25, 1903. He recommended a main system 
        of 7,176 linear feet with a cesspool, manholes and 20 gully grates. This 
        would included 18, 15 and 12-inch pipe running from Second St. along Main 
        St. to Clegg St.. The outlet would be piped along Victoria St. to the 
        Rideau River. A later map shows a variation of this course (<a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Map_Sewers_1903.jpg">See 
        Map</a>). The estimated cost of the main sewer was $9,800, which could 
        be paid in 20 yearly instalments of $720 each.</p>
      <p>Surtees estimated that 6,000 feet of 12 inch and 9,000 feet of 9 inch 
        pipe at a depth of 8 inches would be required for &quot;local improvement 
        sewers&quot;. These sewers would connect the individual residences and 
        businesses to the main sewer. The cost of this would be the responsibility 
        of the ratepayer who would be required to connect as per the new bylaw. 
        It was estimated that the cost would be &quot;about 2.80 cents per lineal 
        foot of frontage&quot; ($2.80?). The total cost of local improvement sewers 
        was estimated at $10,500.</p>
      <p>On May 28, the council received recommendation from the Ontario government 
        to discharge the sewer system into the Rideau. In a letter to the local 
        Board of Health it was recommended that the board grant permission to 
        the village to proceed. The letter indicated that it believed the amount 
        of sewage discharge would be &quot;small&quot; and that the point of discharge 
        would be &quot;only a short distance above the junction of the Rideau 
        with the Ottawa, which receives the sewerage of the whole City of Ottawa&quot;. 
        The rationale was - a little more would not make a big difference!</p>
      <p>The approval for the location of the outfall was subject to the following 
        provisions:</p>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li>the outfall pipe must be 9 inches and carry into the deep water 
            of the stream;</li>
          <li>the village accept all future responsibility if damages occur;</li>
          <li>work be done by an engineer and according to standards;</li>
          <li>future village growth may require that the sewage be purified by 
            another method. </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>By the end of May the necessary information had been obtained and council 
        directed William Lees to prepare a bylaw to obtain a debenture for the 
        building of the sewer and to make special provision for tax exemption 
        for a future waterworks company. He was paid $20 for this work. The debenture 
        was for $10,000 at 4% interest to be paid in annual instalments of $578.31. 
      </p>
      <p>The bylaw was to take effect on June 9, 1903 after a vote of the ratepayers. 
        The vote was held with 155 supporting the initiative and 14 against. However 
        the vote for the waterworks exemption failed &#150; more on this later.</p>
      <p>In July a Sewer Committee was formed and directed to approach various 
        landowners to acquire the rights to lay pipe across their land so as to 
        obtain an outlet to the Rideau River. A key piece of land controlled by 
        the Department of Railways and Canals was located on the vacant Ordnance 
        Reserve. This was part of Lot A, which was part of Lot G in Concession 
        C, Rideau Front in Nepean Township (the village was still part of Nepean). 
        This land today is the vacant government land just east of Brunswick Ave., 
        which used to be the city dump. The reason given by the village to obtain 
        permission to use this land was that &quot;it will greatly improve the 
        sanitary condition of this Municipality, and prevent offensive matter 
        passing into the Rideau Canal as it naturally does at present&quot; (Letter 
        &#150; Feb. 25, 1903). After exchanges of numerous letters and plans the 
        Department rented the land to the village for an annual fee of $1.00.

      <p>Construction of the sewers began in the summer and Gustave Lemke of 24 
        3<sup>rd</sup> St. was appointed as inspector of sewers. Bylaw #88 passed 
        on Dec. 7 regulated the use of the sewer system and requirements for connection. 
        Restrictions included the discharge into sewers of &quot;any garbage, 
        offal (trimmings of animals), dead animals, vegetable parings, ashes, 
        cinders, rags, sawdust shavings or manure&quot;. It was also illegal to 
        connect any cesspool, privy vault or pit, stable yard, wooden drain or 
        the exhaust pipe of a steam engine to the sewer. It was permissible to 
        discharge &quot;faeces, urine, the necessary water closet paper and liquid 
        house slops and such liquid manufacturing wastes permitted by the Village&quot;. 
        That seemed to cover all the sources although one has to wonder what happened 
        to all the other material not allowed in the sewers!</p>
      <b></b> 
      <p><u><b>And water too</b></u>!</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>With the sewer system in the planning stage, council turned their attention 
        to the problem of providing a source of clean potable water for human 
        consumption; and a pressurized source of water to fight fires.</p>
      <p>As mentioned above council had received an offer to build a private waterworks 
        for the village from a delegation of ratepayers in February. It included: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li>William Lees, (son of Robert Lees) and a major landowner in the 
            village. He led the delegation.</li>
          <li>James Ballantyne, a previous Reeve, co-owner of Ballantyne Coal 
            on East Ave. and one of the most powerful and creative men in the 
            village; </li>
          <li>Bernard Slattery, listed as a butcher at 245 Main St. in the directory, 
            he also had an extensive farm in the south of the village and was 
            one of the largest livestock importers in the region;</li>
          <li>Ira Bower, a dentist who resided at 208 East Ave., he was the son 
            of John C. Bower, head of one of the more prominent families in the 
            village;</li>
          <li>And Charles Francis Winter. There is more on this interesting person 
            <a href="../../notables.htm">here.</a> </li>

      <p>Before enacting any legislation it was necessary to receive approval 
        from the provincial and local boards of health. To that end water samples 
        were taken from the Rideau River on April 15 and sent by express packed 
        in ice to Toronto for analysis. The council received a report, dated April 
        20th, from the laboratory of the Provincial Board of Health. <img src="../Image%20Library/Documents/sm/D_Board_Health_logo.jpg" width="131" height="127" align="right">Two 
        analyses still exist in the archive <a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_Water_Report.jpg">and 
        one can be seen here</a>. The tests measured such parameters as turbidity, 
        ammonia, nitrogen, oxygen and chlorine. The microscopic analysis showed 
        a &quot;slight yellow precipitate of vegetable growth and debris&quot; 
        and the water colour was &quot;decidedly yellow&quot;. The report concluded 
        that the water quality was variable and asked when the underground samples 
        would be sent. There is no surviving record of the underground samples. 
        It should also be noted here that, unlike present-day water quality analysis, 
        testing for bacterial pollution from such sources as faecal contamination 
        was apparently not conducted in 1903.</p>
      <p>Council received a final report, dated May 30<sup>th</sup>, from the 
        provincial office in early June. The report indicated that sources other 
        than the river were &quot;preferable as public supplies for drinking purposes&quot;. 
        It went on to indicate the samples &quot;taken from wells at points several 
        hundred yards away from the canal &quot; were &quot;very satisfactory&quot; 
        and that &quot;the water of these wells be approved as a source of public 
        water for the Village of Ottawa East&quot;. </p>
      <p>It was then decided to use subsurface water as the source. From City 
        of Ottawa records in 1908, after annexation, there was a request to sell 
        the property owned by the water company. The lot was located near the 
        intersection of Riverdale and Main, approximately where the hydro building 
        is now located.</p>
      <p>To build this privately owned waterworks, some concessions were needed 
        from council. Bylaw #82 authorized the council to enter into agreement 
        with the new Ottawa East Water Company giving the company the exclusive 
        right to provide water to the village. While the actual agreement no longer 
        exists, it appears from the council minutes of May 14 that part of the 
        agreement involved the granting of tax-free status to the company for 
        10 years. All of this was to be voted on by the ratepayers on June 9<sup>th</sup>.</p>
      <p>The vote for a waterworks was held in conjunction with that of the sewer 
        system. Both passed with large majorities. But . . . the vote for the 
        waterworks was not large enough! Apparently for a bylaw of this nature 
        a majority of at least 66% of the listed ratepayers was required for passage. 
        The clerk pointed out that there was total of 238 ratepayers on the roll 
        of which 150 voted for the bylaw (with 18 against) and this represented 
        only 63%. The waterworks initiative therefore, according to law, could 
        not be passed. </p>
      <p>But from the very inception of the Village in 1888, residents had always 
        been somewhat creative in their solutions to dilemmas particularly when 
        this involved interpretation of provincial laws. At the subsequent June 
        15 meeting, the council considered an alternative approach upon receiving 
        a letter from the Water Company. A motion was put forward to relieve the 
        company of any obligation under Bylaw #82 since the tax exemption did 
        not pass &#150; this motion carried. A second motion to construct a waterworks 
        owned by the municipality was defeated. Council then created Bylaw #83 
        to amend the previous one. To relieve the financial pressure on the new 
        company, it was proposed that, instead of tax exemption, the company would 
        be paid set rates for fire hydrants. These rates were $25 in the first 
        year for each fire hydrant used by the village; $30/hydrant in year two; 
        and $35/hydrant for the next 8 years. In return, when the revenue derived 
        by the company exceeded 6% on the &quot;paid up value of capital stock 
        of the company&quot; the rates for hydrants and water would be lowered 
        by that excess amount. No ratepayer consent was required with this type 
        of bylaw! It was read a first, second and third time that night. The engineer 
        was then instructed to continue with the plans for the water system. Ottawa 
        East was to have water at last!</p>
      <p>No information regarding construction of the system has been found so 
        far. But a 1905 water bill for the village does survive and be seen <a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_WATER_BILL.jpg">here</a>. 
        From this it appears that there were no meters used and water rates were 
        based on assessment rates. The rates ranged from $6 to $10 per year. For 
        institutions, each additional bed or boarder cost $1 per year. Even vacant 
        lots and unoccupied buildings had to pay a set fee. For building materials, 
        the fee was set on the number of bricks (10 cents/1000), masonry (5 cents/ton) 
        or plastering (10 cents/100 yards). Yearly rates for public baths were 
        $4; flush toilets in a hotel cost $5, horses $1 and a cow was levied 50 
        cents. What a concept - this was monopoly with a license to print money! 
        And each bill ended with an admonition, printed in larger bold type, warning 
        people not to share their water supply with any other consumer. The actual 
        schedule for water rates can be seen<a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_Water_Sched_Rates.jpg"> 
        here</a>.</p>
      <p>As a postscript to this exciting story of municipal intrigue, after the 
        City annexed the Village in 1907, the Water Company rejected the offer 
        it received for compensation from Ottawa. In 1908 the now-defunct Ottawa 
        East Water Company received, as a result of arbitration, over $62,000 
        for its trouble.</p>
      <b> 
      <p><u>Nuisances and Immoralities</u>!</p>
      </b> 
      <p>Perhaps one of the most interesting bylaws ever passed in the history 
        of the Ottawa East Village was #90, which came into force on December 
        7, 1903. Flush with the successes of a new sewer and waterworks, the council 
        deemed it necessary to also clean up the morals of the village. To do 
        this an extensive bylaw (of 8 pages in length) was written to cover a 
        huge spectrum of activities that residents considered minor nuisances 
        or highly immoral. It is unlikely that the village was fraught with crime 
        or lascivious activities though. Remember that council would not allow 
        Mr. Lussier to install a pool table in his barber shop! Perhaps this was 
        council&#146;s way of acknowledging that the village was now a responsible 
        and desirable place in which to reside. Whatever the reason, it makes 
        for interesting reading. </p>
      <p>Some of the highlights of this tome of correctness include laws that 
        forbid any person to:</p>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li>openly or indecently exposing themselves, pictures, paintings, writing 
            or inscriptions in any public place or on any wall, building or fence;</li>
          <li>use &quot;any obscene blasphemous or grossly insulting language&quot;;</li>
          <li>threaten bodily harm to any person or challenging any person to

      <p>There are more restrictions in the bylaw but the above list represents 
        the general idea of what the council was trying to regulate. The penalties 
        for transgression ranged from fines of $1 to $50 with jail time and hard 
        labour imposed for failure to pay. Any person convicted in a court was 
        required to pay the costs of the court and the peace officer.</p>
      <p>With that the council dissolved and an election was held on Dec. 29<sup>th</sup>. 
      </p>
      <p>All in all, 1903 was a very interesting year for the village! </p>
