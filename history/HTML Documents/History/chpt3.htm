      mode of transport was walking. Streets of heavy wooden planks were preferable

      <p>There had been little development in the Ottawa East area after Ottawa achieved 
        city status in 1855. There was interest on the part of some lawyers as 
        the land was relatively inexpensive and had ready access via the Canal 
        Road to the courthouse in Lower Town. William Ring and Charles O&#146;Connor 
        bought the land in Conc. C, Lot G east of the Canal from John Hickey in 
        1859 and created a small subdivision. However, with no buyer interest, 
        Martin O&#146;Gara subsequently purchased the northern section in 1866; 
        and the southern half was sold to John Graham in 1868. The two largest 
        landowners in Conc. D, Lot G were Robert Lees and Thomas Kealey. In 1863, 
        the Oblate Order (Oblates of Mary Immaculate) purchased most of Conc. 
        D, Lot H for St. Joseph&#146;s Scholasticate</p>
      <p>Henry F. Westbrook, a black American &quot;ran a crude tavern east of 
        the canal on the road allowance&quot; (near Clegg and Echo Drive). &quot; 
        He sold the property to Isaac Biggars in 1865, a deal which apparently 
        included his wife as well&quot; <b><font size="2">(3)</font></b>.</p>
      <p>John Graham used his acreage as a market garden to supply his two hotels 
        in Lower Town, the Albion<a href="../Image%20Library/Buildings/CA5775_Graham_Alex_House.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Buildings/sm/CA5775_Graham_Alex_House_sm.jpg" width="200" height="133" align="right" alt="Graham House - Ardagh Square - 45 Main St." border="0"></a> 
        and the Grand Union. Years later he built a brick house called Ardagh 
        Square which is shown here. This square is approximately where De Mazenod 
        School is now located.</p>
      <p>It is difficult to arrive at a definitive list of all the residents in 
        in Ottawa East in the 1860's as many were <a href="../Image%20Library/Buildings/PA132251.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Buildings/sm/PA132251sm.jpg" width="173" height="128" align="left" vspace="3" hspace="3" alt="Champagne Barn on Canal Road - c1898" border="0"></a>simply 
        not recorded if they did not own land. The Nepean Assessment Rolls give 
        some idea of the population at that time. To that end the Rolls for 1860 
        to 1866 were extracted and reproduced <a href="../Databases/Nepean_Assess_1860_66.htm">here</a>. 
        It should be noted however that some of the information appears contradictory 
        in spots so it must be viewed with caution. The barn shown here was built 
        by the Champagne family on the Canal Road (Echo Drive). Photographed in 
        1898, it is the oldest building photographed in Ottawa East. Two other 
        surviving buildings from this time period include the Hay and Bower residences.</p>
      <p>By the end of the 1860&#146;s, the increasing prosperity that came with 
        growing housing needs from a burgeoning civil service and an expanding 
        sawn lumber trade initiated a land boom. The Ottawa Citizen newspaper 
        noted on the 23<sup>rd</sup> of November, 1871 that &quot;building operations 
        were never more lively than at present . . . (with) communities rapidly 
        rising in numbers and importance in the immediate suburbs . . . only divided 
        from the city by imaginary lines&quot; <b><font size="1">(4)</font></b>. 
        A record number of registered plans of subdivision were drawn including 
        Archville West.</p>
      <p><b><u>Archville West</u></b></p>
      <p>William Stewart&#146;s holdings, which included most of Lot F in Conc. 
        C and D, passed to his wife <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Reg_Plan_48_new.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/sm/M_Reg_Plan_48_header_sm.jpg" width="157" height="138" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Original Plan of Archville" border="0"></a>Catherine 
        upon his death. On September 19, 1873 she registered 200 acres of Lot 
        F, Conc. D in the name of one of her sons &#150; Archibald <b><font size="1">(5)</font></b>. 
        That same day he registered a plan of subdivision (<a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Reg_Plan_48_new.jpg">No. 
        48</a>) calling the development Archville West. It is assumed that he 
        included the qualifier of West in that the particular part was to the 
        west of his new holdings. The plan included the following streets with 
        the modern names in brackets: Second St. West (Greenfield), Second (Old 
        Greenfield), Third (Montcalm), Fourth (Havelock), Fifth (Harvey), Center 
        (Concord North) and a Concession Road Allowance (Echo Drive).</p>
      <p><b><u>Village of Spenceville</u></b></p>
      <p><a href="../Image%20Library/People/X_Spence_Rev_new.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/People/sm/X_Spence_Rev_new_sm.jpg" width="150" height="235" align="left" alt="Rev. Spence of St. Andrew's Church" border="0"></a>Another 
        plan of subdivision in Ottawa East at this time was the Village of Spenceville. 
        The plan entitled &quot;Plan of the Village of Spenceville being the subdivision 
        into lots of Park Lot no. XV as shown on a plan of the subdivision<a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Reg_Plan_102_new.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/sm/M_Reg_Plan_102_title_sm.jpg" width="269" height="127" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Original Plan of Spenceville" border="0"></a> 
        into park lots&quot;. An interesting title to be sure! It appears that 
        the plan was dated December 12 1868 and registered on July 10, 1869. There 
        was no plan number ascribed to the plan at this time however. It appears 
        again in the record (Land Reg. Office,Vol.7, p. 9) as Plan #102 registered 
        on December 13, 1888. The reason for this is unclear at present. The actual 
        plan can be seen <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Reg_Plan_102_new.jpg">here</a>. 
        Spenceville was named after Rev. Alexander Spence of St. Andrew's church. 
      </p>
      <p>The Spenceville Plan showed the layout of the following streets: Gordon 
        (Hazel), Herridge, Clegg, Rideau (Canal Road, now Echo Drive), McGillivray, 
        Drummond, Bronson (Glenora) and Concession Road Allowance (Main).</p>
      <p>By the mid-1870&#146;s, the speculative fever that gripped all of the 
        Ottawa area disappeared. The economic depression that began in the United 
        States had quickly spread throughout North America. Vacancy rates soared 
        and with an oversupply of registered lots, no additional subdivisions 
        appeared in Ottawa East. This was a period of hard times for the average working 
        person. &quot;Soup kitchens and bread lines functioned in various parts 
        of the city funded by voluntary subscriptions&quot; <font size="1"><b>(6)</b></font>. 
        Archville by the end of the decade consisted of a few impressive homes 
        and about &quot;56 working families living back of the Ballantyne family&#146;s 
        canal-side coal yard&quot; <b><font size="1">(7)</font></b>.</p>
      <p>With a desire to keep taxes down, there were few demands on the Nepean 
        Township Council for improvements in the small community. It must be remembered 
        that although Ottawa East was just next door to the City, whatever support and 
        services it received came from a decidedly rural council dominated by 
        farmers who expected the community to be annexed at any moment. There 
        were no social services or planning. Nepean administration consisted of 
        a clerk and a treasurer located in Bells Corners. The council met regularly 
        but, apart from paying bills for such items as burying dead animals left 
        in the road, there was virtually no initiation of programs or projects. 
        They simply responded with a yes or a no to ratepayers&#146; requests 
        that were within the very limited legislative authority of a township.</p>
      <p>The near total lack of improvements in the community was not because 
        of poor planning &#150; there was no planning! And there were no health, 
        police or road departments either. The township had the authority to buy 
        groceries for families afflicted with smallpox but it could not prescribe 
        regulations to limit the spread of the deadly disease. Council could pay 
        to have a dead dog removed from a public well but had no peace officer 
        to lay a charge for the offensive act. All roadwork in the township was 
        done by &quot;statute labour&quot;. This system required residents to 
        spend a specified amount of time working on roads as determined by a local 
        overseer. A person had the option of not working and paying a larger tax 
        bill or providing a surrogate in his place.</p>
      <p align="center"><a href="../Image%20Library/Construction/CA17000_Statute_Labour__1880.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Construction/sm/CA17000_Statute_Labour__1880_sm.jpg" width="350" height="129" alt="Statute Labour gang on Fallowfield Road in 1880" border="0"></a></p>
      <p>Statute labour and other ratepayer initiated improvements were more often 
        than not subsidized in part by township funds. Such was the case with 
        the building of the Hurdman&#146;s Bridge.</p>
      <p>In 1872 there were few bridges across the Rideau River <b><font size="1">(8)</font></b>. 
        Billings Bridge (originally called the <a href="../Image%20Library/River/X_Billings_bridge.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/River/sm/X_Billings_bridge_sm.jpg" width="256" height="173" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Early version of Billings Bridge - no date" border="0"></a>Farmer&#146;s 
        Bridge) was built in 1830 <b><font size="1">(9)</font></b>. The first 
        permanent bridge (not swept away by the spring flood) between New Edinburgh 
        and Ottawa was built in 1842 <b><font size="1">(10)</font></b>. For agriculturists 
        producing crops east of the river in Gloucester Township this necessitated 
        a long drive by horse and wagon to reach the markets of the city. As well, 
        landowners in Ottawa East such as Lees and Stewart wanted to increase the value 
        of their property with a link across the river. In October of 1872 and 
        again in July of 1874, residents petitioned Nepean Council for permission 
        and support in building a bridge over the Rideau River at a location, 
        which is today just north of the modern Hurdman&#146;s Bridge. The original 
        pylons for this bridge still stand today. The bridge was already being 
        &quot;built by voluntary private subscription&quot; <font size="1"><b>(11)</b></font> 
        from people such as Lees, Thomas Keeley and George Hurdman. Council <a href="../Image%20Library/River/RW6_Hurdman_Bridge_collapse_insert_new.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/River/sm/RW6_Hurdman_Bridge_collapse_insert_new_sm.jpg" width="200" height="139" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Early version of Hurdman Bridge - no date" border="0"></a>committed 
        $400 to the project. In 1876 Archibald Stewart asked council to waive 
        any rights to the bridge. The township agreed with the conditions that: 
        all private contributors transferred their ownership rights to the Russell 
        Road Company; that the company build a macadamized road (packed stone) 
        from the bridge to the southern <a href="../Image%20Library/Construction/PA133412.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Construction/sm/PA133412sm.jpg" width="200" height="146" align="left" vspace="3" hspace="4" alt="Example of macadamization" border="0"></a>limit 
        of the city; and no tolls would ever be collected in the Nepean part of 
        the road <b><font size="1">(12)</font></b>. The road was laid out across 
        land owned by Lees, Kealey and Stewart in 1877 but was ultimately built 
        by statute labour and financial support from the township under the supervision 
        of Archibald Stewart. The remnant of that original road follows approximately 
        the orientation of Hurdman Road up to Mann Avenue today.</p>
      <p><b>The People &#150; 1871 to 1881</b></p>
      <p>At this point in the story it is important to look at a cross-section 
        of the people and activities in the Ottawa East area to better understand the community 
        that was now rapidly emerging. What had begun in the 1820&#146;s and 30&#146;s 
        as a rural community of a few farms had now evolved into a burgeoning 
        industrial and residential locale in the northern part with scattered 
        farms and market gardens in the center and southern parts.</p>
      <p>Who were these people? Where did they come from? What did they do? The 
        answers to these and many more questions are, in part, included in this 
        next section. While it is impossible to provide a definitive list of every 
        resident, analysis of records of known inhabitants can give a glimpse 
        of the people who formed the early Ottawa East community.</p>
      <p>To do this a variety of records has been consulted including the 1871 
        census manuscript, the 1881 census manuscript and CD-ROM version, the 
        existing directories from 1868 to 1881 and various and sundry history 
        books. No one source contains all the answers. What follows is an amalgamation 
        of these sources, along with some inductive thinking, that illuminates 
        the lives of the people of Ottawa East in the period 1871 to 1881. <a href="Germans/Ottawa_East_Germans.htm">For 
        an in-depth look at the German Community of Ottawa East go here</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Agriculturists &#150; Farmers or Gardeners?</b></p>
      <p>The various sources consulted list Ottawa East residents involved in 
        the tilling of the soil as either farmers or gardeners. What is the difference? 
        While there is no definitive description is available at this point, it 
        appears that the size of the acreage, type of crop and proximity to residential 
        areas determines the classification. Those who live close or in the small 
        residential areas such as Archville were usually listed as gardeners &#150; 
        perhaps this was the precursor to the modern term of &quot;market gardener&quot;. 
        Agriculturists in the southern part held larger acreage and their crops 
        were mainly used to support livestock. This generalization however, does 
        not hold in all situations as can be seen in the following cross-section 
        of examples.</p>
      <p><b>Daniel (Donald?) McGregor</b> purchased a lease for the south half 
        part of blocks No. 9, 10 and 11 in Conc. C, Lot H from the Temporal Committee 
        of St. Andrew&#146;s Presbyterian Church on April 1, 1871 (Land Records). 
        According to the 1871 Census (Schedule #4) he was a gardener of 14 improved 
        acres with 8 acres in pasture and 6 in gardens/orchards. He grew 200 bushels 
        (bu.) of potatoes on 1 acre and listed his only other crops as 30 bu. 
        of turnips and 100 bu. of carrots/other root crops. </p>
      <p>The Nominal Schedule (#1) of the 1871 Census lists him as married (although 
        his wife was not present at the time of enumeration), 48 years of age 
        and living with his son Duncan aged 12. Both were born in Scotland. Schedule 
        #3 indicates that he owned 12 of the acres leased which is somewhat confusing. 
        He had no livestock and did not harvest any cordwood.</p>
      <p><b>John Hickey</b> was a member of a family that owned large tracts of 
        land in the Ottawa East area, both east and west of the Canal. The 1871 Census 
        (lists him as a gardener owning 14 improved acres with 8 in pasture and 
        6 in gardens/orchards. This is comparable to McGregor shown above. According 
        to land records he purchased this parcel of land east of the Canal on 
        Oct. 5 1868 from William Hickey (his father?). Specifically this was the 
        East Half of Conc. C, Lot G.</p>
      <p>He produced 200 bu. of potatoes, 30 bu. of turnips and 100 bu. of carrots/other 
        roots. Livestock included 2 horses; I milk cow and 3 pigs. He cut 30 cords 
        of firewood that year. The family had 2 carriages/sleighs, 2 cars/wagons/sleds 
        and 1 pleasure/common boat.</p>
      <p>Hickey, born in Ontario was 39 in 1871. His wife Mary, born in Ireland, 
        was 37. The couple had 5 children: Elizabeth (10), Isabella (7), Margaret 
        Ann (6), John (4) and Jannett? (2), all born in Ontario. The home must 
        have been large as 2 servants lived with the family namely Jane Cooper, 
        age 40, born in Quebec; and Morris Moore, aged 50, born in Ireland. </p>
      <p>Given the family connections and extensive land ownership, it appears 
        that Hickey did not exist only on his profit working as a gardener. </p>
      <p><b>Mathew Thomas Derenzy</b>, listed in the 1871 Census as a gardener, 
        was located on 5 improved acres in Conc. C; Lot F. He was shown as an 
        employee not an owner. The Stewart family owned this lot so Derenzy probably 
        worked for them in other capacities.</p>
      <p>He raised 25 bu. of potatoes on 1 acre, 20 bu. of carrots/other roots 
        and 1 ton of hay on 1 acre. He had 1 horse and 1 pig. He didn&#146;t cut 
        any firewood and owned 2 carriages/sleighs.</p>
      <p>Born in Ireland he was 46 in 1871 and his wife Catherine, born in Ontario 
        was 31. They had 4 children: Samuel Baird (13), William (16 &#150; a confectioner), 
        John Henry (18 &#150; a painter) and Sarah Jane (20 &#150; a schoolteacher). 
        Henry Chatterton, a gardener aged 30, born in England, lived with the 
        family.</p>
      <p><b>Lewis Williams</b> had one of the largest farms in the Ottawa East area located 
        in the south at Conc. C, Lot K. He was the son of the original Lewis who 
        was one of the first settlers in the area arriving in 1817. <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Williams_map_1828.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/sm/M_Williams_map_1828_sm.jpg" width="172" height="141" align="right" alt="Map of Williams Property" border="0"></a></p>
      <p>Working 60 improved acres with 3 acres in pasture and 10 in gardens/orchards, 
        he produced 350 bu. of oats, 30 bu. of peas, 50 bu. of corn, 700 bu. of 
        potatoes(on 6 acres), 12 tons of hay and 30 bu. of fruit (pears, plums, 
        other fruit) and 50 lbs. of butter. Livestock included: 3 horse, 5 milk 
        cows, 3 pigs and 14 hives of bees. Firewood cut totalled 45 cords.</p>
      <p>The farm consisted of 1 dwelling house, 3 barns/stables, 2 carriages/sleighs, 
        2 cars/wagons/sleds and 1 pleasure/common boat.</p>
      <p>Williams, born in England, was 64 in 1871. His wife Oreilla, born in 
        the United States was 52. Lewis fathered 7 children: Lewis Jr. (26 &#150; 
        farmer), David (24 &#150; farmer), Mary (18), Martha (16), Caroline (14), 
        Francis (11 &#150; male) and Harriet (8). Another child, Daniel? Johnston, 
        age 3 and born in the United States, lived with the family. Perhaps this 
        child was kin to his wife.</p>
      <p>There is much more on this very interesting family in the <a href="../../notables.htm">Notables 
        Section</a>. The original farmland still existed in the 1930&#146;s as 
        shown by this <a href="../Image%20Library/Airphotos/X_rideau%20garden%201931.jpg">air

      <p><b>Robert Lees </b>was one of the most important figures in the Ottawa East community, 
        Listed in the 1871 Census as a county attorney, from his holdings and 
        agricultural activities it appears that he was also a very successful 
        farmer.</p>
      <p><a href="../Image%20Library/Buildings/X__Wildwood.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Buildings/sm/X__Wildwood_sm.jpg" width="150" height="106" align="left" alt="Wildwood - home of the Lees Family - built c1863" border="0" vspace="4" hspace="4"></a>Located 
        on 30 improved acres in Conc. D, Lot G, Lees purchased the majority of 
        this land from Martin Kealey between 1859 and 1862 (Ontario Land Records). 
        He had 7 acres in pasture and 2 acres in gardens/orchards. Crops included 
        200 bu. of oats, 2 bu. of beans, 240 bu. of potatoes (on 2 acres), 70 
        bu. of turnips, 350 bu. of carrots/other roots, 6 tons of hay (on 10 acres). 
        As can be seen by photos and<a href="../Image%20Library/Agriculture/CA7905_Lees_farm_cart.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Agriculture/sm/CA7905_Lees_farm_cart_sm.jpg" width="150" height="102" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="3" alt="Lees Farm cart driving just south of present-day Lees Ave. - no date" border="0"></a> 
        descriptions in the <a href="../../notables.htm">Notables Section</a>, 
        extensive orchards and vines were maintained producing 42 lbs. of grapes, 
        8 bu. of apples and 10 bu. of pears/plums/other fruit. He also managed 
        to garner 40 lbs. of butter and 47 lbs. of honey.</p>

        included 2 horses, 2 milk cows, 1 other of horned cattle, 10 pigs (2 were 
        slaughtered) and 4 hives of bees. No firewood was listed. He owned 3 carriages/sleighs, 
        3 cars/wagons/sleighs and 3 ploughs/cultivators.</p>
      <p>Along with his legal work and farming activities, Lees was a major land 
        speculator. Schedule 3 of the 1871 Census indicates that he owned 870 
        acres, with 24 building lots, 4 dwelling houses and 2 barns/stables.</p>
      <p>Born in Scotland, he was 54 in 1871 and along with his Ontario born wife 
        Jessie, aged 46, had 5 <a href="../Image%20Library/Agriculture/PA134230_Lees_Farm_CowsNearRiver.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Agriculture/sm/PA134230_Lees_Farm_CowsNearRiver_sm.jpg" width="200" height="154" align="right" alt="Lees Farm pasture with cows - no date - notice Hurdman Bridge in background" vspace="5" hspace="5" border="0"></a>children: 
        Ella (17), Victoria (16), Elizabeth (13), William (11) and Jessie (6). 
        Living with the family was John Lynch (19), a labourer born in Ontario; 
        and Rosana Halfpenny (18) a housemaid born in Ontario.</p>
      <p>In total, it appears that Lees was involved in many pursuits, which provided 
        for a privileged lifestyle for his family. His fascinating life is chronicled 
        in the <a href="../../notables.htm">Notables Section</a>, which includes 
        an extensive collection of family writings and very early photographs.

      <p><b>Barrels, Bricks and Civil Servants</b></p>
      <p>The northern part of the Ottawa East community, as noted earlier, was a combination 
        of industries, agricultural activities and residences. To identify specific 
        people living in this part in 1871 has been made difficult in that the 
        original enumerator seems to have relied on some as-yet-unknown system 
        of identifying some lots in Conc. C and D. The actual boundary of the 
        enumeration districts have been lost to time. The available directories 
        of residents, which begin in 1864, are incomplete in that these were commercial 
        endeavours and not that concerned with gathering all the information. 
        In an attempt to remedy this confusion, information from the directories 
        and the 1871 and 1881 censuses have been cross-referenced. For example 
        the first detailed directory of Archville appeared in 1877 and therefore 
        it has been assumed that some of the people listed here were also present 
        at the same locations (or nearby) prior to 1877. What follows therefore 
        is an overview of the northern part of Ottawa East relying heavily on the 1877-81 
        Archville directories (<a href="../Databases/ArchDir_77to81.htm">see table 
        here</a>) and the census material. </p>
      <p>The Archville directories for this 5-year span show 37 employment &#145;types&#146;. 
        This is approximate in that certain related jobs have been grouped together. 
        For example, a gas fitter is considered to be a plumber. Given this there 
        were 133 people listed as employed in this 5-year period. Of this 29 worked 
        as labourers (21.8%), 15 in the civil service (11.2%) and 11 carpenters 
        (8.2%). It is interesting to note that when <a href="../Image%20Library/Construction/PA130013_Stone_Masons_VictoriaMuseam.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Construction/sm/X_OE_stone%20cutters_sm.jpg" width="150" height="109" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Ottawa East Stone Masons" border="0"></a>several 
        of these employment &#145;types&#146; are grouped together under &#145;building 
        trades&#146; (3 brick layers, 4 cabinet makers, 11 carpenters, 3 painters, 
        3 plasterers, 3 plumbers and 3 stonemasons), this grouping becomes the 
        largest occupation (22.5%). This figure is very close to what Elliott 
        <b><font size="1">(13)</font></b> found in the 1891 analysis of Ottawa East.</p>
      <p>It is clear therefore that Ottawa East in the decade 1871-81 was predominantly 
        blue collar. The table <a href="../Databases/ArchDir_77to81.htm">here</a> 
        shows the actual job descriptions over the 5-year period of 1877 to 1881.</p>
      <p>The 1871 census in Schedule #6 lists 7 industrial establishments in Sub-district 
        A-1, which includes Ottawa East. The list includes 2 brick manufacturers, 2 breweries, 
        a blacksmith, a tannery and a weaving shop. Of these the largest and only 
        one positively identified as being in Ottawa East was the brick making business 
        of O&#146;Dell. The two breweries, owned by the Rochester family, were 
        probably located in Conc. Lot I situated to the west of the canal and 
        therefore not part of Ottawa East.</p>
      <p><b><a name="Horace"></a>Horace C. O&#146;Dell (also Odell), </b>born 
        in the United States about 1818 of German origin, he emigrated <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_OE_1879_labels.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/sm/M_OE_1879_labels_sm.jpg" width="160" height="166" align="left" alt="1879 Belden Atlas" border="0" vspace="3" hspace="4"></a>to 
        Canada and ultimately to the Ottawa East area in the late 1860&#146;s. 
        The 1871 census shows him living in Conc. D on Lot 1 with his Ontario 
        born wife of English descent (age 45) and his daughter Theresa, born in 
        Ontario, aged 20. The 1877 directory gives the address of the family as 
        4<sup>th</sup> Street (which is now Havelock St.). It is unlikely that 
        his home was in the brickyard he owned. The 1876 Belden Atlas locates 
        a brickyard in Conc. D, on the Archibald Stewart land, just east of the 
        Hurdman Road about the center of the Lot F.</p>
      <p>In 1871, O&#146;Dell produced 1,500,000 bricks for an aggregate value 
        of $9,000. These figures appear in <a href="../Image%20Library/People/X_Odell_Agnes__wifeofClarence.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/People/sm/X_Odell_Agnes__wifeofClarence_sm.jpg" width="159" height="209" align="right" alt="Agnes Odell, wife of Clarence" vspace="5" hspace="5" border="0"></a>Schedule 
        #6 and if correct, that was a lot of bricks! This was seasonal work as 
        only 5 working months were listed. Workers included 15 men and 5 boys 
        for an aggregate wage of $2,000. His raw materials consisted of clay and 
        sand (3000 cubic yards) and 300 cords of wood used to fire the brick. 
        The wood cost $4.00 a cord and Schedule #4 shows that he cut 500 cords 
        total for the year. O'Dell mined the clay and sand from pits located at 
        the end of Spinghurst Avenue at the river.</p>
      <p>O&#146;Dell owned 10 acres with 6 improved in Conc. D. The land records 
        indicate that the family also owned land in Conc. C in the name of his 
        wife Adeline. He had 6 acres in pasture and half an acre in garden/orchard. 
        The pasture was used to feed his 5 horses and 1 cow to feed his family. 
        There was 1 dwelling house, 2 carriages/sleighs, I wagon/sled and 1 plow/cultivator.

          the Ottawa Rail Terminal is now). They apparently allowed the travelling 
          public and the township to use the bridge in return for township and
