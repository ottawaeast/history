    <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The beginning of organized 
      settlement was around 1791 with the establishment of Upper Canada and a 
      survey of the land. On October 6, 1792, the Township of Nepean was granted 
      <font size=1><b>(1)</b></font>. The area was named after Sir Evan Nepean 
      (1751 &#150; 1822), an Under-Secretary at the Home Office in <img src="../Image%20Library/People/X_Nepean_Evan.jpg" width="150" height="230" align="left">London, 
      and the administrator for Canadian affairs from 1782 to 1794 <font size=1><b>(2)</b></font>. 
      He never actually visited Canada but that was typical of most English colonial 
      officials at the time. Official policy in the 1790&#146;s was to encourage 
      settlement in both Upper and Lower (Quebec) Canada. This was particularly 
      important given the loss of the American Colonies to the south and the massive 
      influx of British Empire Loyalists fleeing from their rebellious neighbours. 
      The idea was to create a permanent white population to prevent further American 
      expansion and to consolidate the British hold. By granting free land in 
      townships such as Nepean, the British government hoped to speed the process 
      of settlement. The order of the day was to settle the land by granting the 
      responsibility to groups of &quot;leaders and associates&quot; led by an 
      individual who would be given a large personal tract of land for his efforts.

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The first person to be granted 
        land in this way was an Irish veteran of the Revolutionary War, one George<a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_concessions.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/sm/M_concessions_sm.jpg" width="200" height="118" align="right" alt="Nepean Township-1821 for  Earl of Dalhousie Governor-in-chief of British North America (Canada) from 1820 to 1828" border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5"></a> 
        Hamilton <font size=1><b>(3)</b></font>. He claimed a group of 143 settlers 
        would arrive in 1794. It soon became apparent however the group would 
        not settle in Nepean, as they feared isolation without a road from the 
        St. Lawrence River. With the group idea not working, the government changed 
        policy and allowed grants to individual settlers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">By 1800 there was an increased 
        demand for land in Nepean from the <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_1828_map_new.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/sm/M_1828_map_sm.jpg" width="200" height="165" align="left" alt="An 1828 map showing the Clergy Reserve (Glebe) " border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5"></a>original 
        Loyalist refugees who had been promised land for their children when they 
        became of age. In 1812, in the midst of a war with the United States, 
        &quot;over 200 grants encompassing half of the land in the township were 
        made to Loyalist heirs&quot; <font size=1><b>(4)</b></font>. In addition, 
        one-seventh of the land was reserved for the Crown and one-seventh for 
        the church (for example, the clergy reserve that later became known as 
        &quot;The Glebe&quot;). All of this did very little to encourage settlement 
        of the area but it did fuel intense land speculation. And this in turn 
        seriously hindered future settlement patterns and development of the land. 
        A vast number of people, from government officials (including Colonel 
        By) to Loyalists, held their free or cheaply acquired land for future 
        profits did little else to improve the land. This problem persisted well 
        into the Twentieth Century!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Few Loyalists or their heirs 
        ever settled in Nepean; they preferred the rich farmlands along the St. 
        Lawrence River and Lake Ontario. The land they held passed from one person 
        to the next for as little as a pound <font size=1><b>(5)</b></font>. While 
        the population of Nepean Township slowly increased in the first decades 
        of the Nineteenth Century, the number of land speculators abounded with 
        hopes for future profit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Much of the land in the northeast 
        part of the township was purchased by the Loyalist Fraser family, who 
        <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_1828_rideau_lots_new.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/sm/M_1828_rideau_lots_new_sm.jpg" width="200" height="333" align="right" border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Survey of 1828 Rideau Lots"></a> 
        by 1821 owned 17,000 acres in 11 townships including 40 Nepean lots along 
        the Rideau River <b><font size="1">(6)</font></b>. The map of Nepean below 
        <b> <font size="1"> (7)</font></b> shows the Fraser holdings as well as 
        the key land speculators. The Clergy Reserve shown in the uppermost northeast 
        part later became the Glebe.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another major landholder in 
        the northeast of Nepean was Lewis Williams, of Monmouthshire, England. 
        A farmer, he landed in Quebec in 1817 and eventually located on the Rideau 
        Front (Rideau River) that <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Williams_map_1828.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/sm/M_Williams_map_1828_sm.jpg" width="200" height="164" align="left" alt="Williams property in Conc. C, Lots L and K" border="0"></a>was 
        not owned by the Fraser family. As Elliott chronicles, &quot;he was a 
        hardworking man and peaceable but easily imposed on&quot; <b><font size="1">(8)</font></b>. 
        In one particular case, he purchased oxen from an American who didn&#146;t 
        actually own the beasts. Of importance to this story is that he became 
        a major landowner and his descendants continued to farm Lot K, Conc. C 
        long after the area was annexed by the City. His original family home 
        still stands at 96 Southern Drive. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">By the early 1820&#146;s, 
        the British government had become distrustful of Upper Canadians with 
        American origin and set about to encourage the settlement of a loyal population. 
        In 1815 the Colonial Office decided to disband units of the regular army 
        in the colony and, coupled with unemployed Scottish weavers, to settle 
        some of these people on the grantable land of the Crown Reserves in Nepean. 
        But by 1824 only 4 families had been settled in the township including 
        Lewis Williams mentioned above. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">By the mid-1820&#146;s then, 
        the situation in Nepean was arguably not much different than the late 
        1780&#146;s. &quot;In 1822, Nepean&#146;s population was only 191&quot; 
        <font size="1"><b>(9)</b></font>, consisting of 35 families scattered 
        about the township. There were 2 half-pay officers, 5 soldiers, 9 Americans, 
        7 Irish Protestant immigrants, 5 Scots, 5 Englishmen, a single Irish Catholic 
        and one of unknown origin <b><font size="1">(10)</font></b>. The few permanent 
        settlers in the northeast of Nepean gravitated more to the Hull Township, 
        established by Philemon Wright in 1800, across the Ottawa River. The establishment 
        of a military depot in 1818 at Richmond had begun to attract more British 
        settlers to Nepean but in general settlement was sparse.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The system of granting free 
        land had not worked. In fact the speculation that the system had fostered 
        had hindered rather than encouraged settlement. The situation was perhaps 
        best summed up by the Earl of Dalhousie, governor-in-chief, who wrote 
        in 1820 that:</font></p>

            Reserves, but generally in large grants made by the Government of 
            Upper Canada which then can neither recall, nor force into settlement. 
            This Township of Nepean . . . therefore may be considered as useless 
            waste, a serious difficulty in the way of prosperity of this part 
            of the Country, and it is mortifying in a greater degree from its 
            possessing the only harbour &amp; approach &#150; by which the great

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">By and the Rideau Canal Lands</font></p>
      </u></b> 
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Still recovering from the 
        loss of the American Colonies and the War of 1812 &#150; 14, as well as 
        the slow increase in settlement, the government began to make a policy 
        changes in 1826. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Free land was now no longer 
        available (except for Loyalists and retired soldiers). Settlers now had 
        to purchase land from the Crown or individual owners such as the Loyalists 
        who held about half of the township land. The Crown Reserves that remained 
        unsettled were sold to the Canada Land Company, a group of speculators 
        based in England. The Clergy Reserves, originally intended for the Church 
        of England (Anglicans), were also authorized for sale. The effect of this 
        policy change was a stimulation of settlement.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Also in 1826, a project was 
        initiated that would significantly alter the geography of Nepean forever. 
        This was the building of the Rideau Canal.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Wary of possible future attack 
        by Americans on the vital shipping route from Montreal to York (Toronto), 
        the British government decided to create an inland route that would bypass 
        the section of the St. Lawrence River from Montreal to Kingston. This 
        required that the Rideau River be made navigable from Kingston to Ottawa 
        as shown by the map here. For more detail on all of the locks required 
        to make the Montreal to Ottawa to Kingston sections navigable, <a href="Montreal%20Ottawa%20Kingston%20System.htm">go

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This massive undertaking was 
        made the responsibility of Lt.-Col. John By of the Royal Engineers. His 
        genius and work continues to influence the face of Ottawa to this day!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The immediate effect of the 
        canal project was to dramatically increase the population, particularly 
        in the<img src="../Image%20Library/People/X_Col_By.jpg" width="150" height="257" align="right">northeast. 
        In 1828, there were 2,758 people listed in the township <font size="1"> 
        <b>(12)</b></font> with a largely transient group of workers centered 
        in ByVille (1826), later Bytown <b><font size="1">(13)</font></b>. Canal 
        workers were mostly Irish immigrants with some Scots, Englishmen and a 
        few French-Canadians. The majority were family men who were to become 
        permanent residents of the area after completion of the canal. In addition, 
        many Nepean farmers sought work on the canal, which resulted in a cash 
        infusion to the rural part of the township.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">From the very outset of canal 
        construction, land speculation and ownership created problems. Lord Dalhousie, 
        now the Governor General had purchase 415 acres of land from Hugh Fraser 
        (see map of holdings) for a town site near the junction of the Ottawa 
        and Rideau Rivers (Bytown). In late 1826, Col. By hired John MacTaggart 
        to investigate possible routes for the waterway from Abram Dow&#146;s 
        Great Swamp to the Ottawa River <b><font size="1">(14)</font></b>. The 
        best route was found to be from the northeast corner of present-day Dow&#146;s 
        Lake, down a natural gully (Preston St.), to the Ottawa River just west 
        of the Chaudi&egrave;re Falls. This land was owned by Captain John Lebreton, 
        purchased in 1820 (now Lebreton Flats). This ownership resulted in one 
        of the more interesting stories of early Ottawa.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Lebreton had paid £499 for 
        the land and offered it back to the government for £3000 <b><font size="1">(15)</font></b>. 
        Upon hearing this, the Dalhousie became furious, accused the Captain of 
        breach of trust by using inside information on the canal to speculate; 
        and then ordered Col. By to alter the route of the canal to the course 
        it follows today.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There is much more to this 
        story but it is sufficient here to note that had Lebreton not purchased 
        the land, <a href="../Image%20Library/Canal/X_Hogsback_1830.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Canal/sm/X_Hogsback_1830_sm.jpg" width="138" height="113" align="left" border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5"></a>then 
        the canal would be flowing down the naturally gully of Preston Street 
        today. The change in course forced Col. By to cut through the solid rock 
        of &#145;Nepean Mountain&#146; (the Notch between Bronson Av. and Bank 
        St. Bridge). This resulted in time delays, a significant loss of life 
        (from black powder excavation of the rock) and a massive cost overrun. 
        Ultimately, these factors contributed to Col. By being recalled to England 
        where he died in disgrace.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Land speculation not only 
        influenced the canal route but it also had a negative effect on the work 
        force. By saw a need for farmland near the canal to settle over 200 families 
        of workers. However, much of the land was owned by the Canada Land Company 
        and was too expensive for the average worker. By then ordered a survey 
        of Ordnance Land (controlled by the military) and apportioned small lots 
        along the canal for workers to rent for a shilling an acre <b><font size="1">(16)</font></b>. 
        In doing so, it was hoped </font></p>
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;<i>to establish 
            . . . along the route a permanent improving chain of settlers whose 
            interests might be identified with the Canal, The waters of which 
            would offer a ready transport as well for their produce to Market, 
            as for the supply of imported Articles necessary for their consumption</i>&quot;

          <p> </p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In essence, By&#146;s foresight 
        became the precursor for later settlement and use of the canal by residents 
        of Ottawa East.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="../Image%20Library/Canal/PA134255_Canal_OppositeExhib_1898.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Canal/sm/PA134255_Canal_OppositeExhib_1898_sm.jpg" width="200" height="140" align="left" alt="Rideau Canal east bank opposite Exhibition grounds" border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5"></a>Organized 
        renting of the Ordnance Land along the canal deteriorated however after 
        Col. By was recalled to England. He had neglected to notify the Surveyor 
        General of his apportionment of the land to workers. As a result, the 
        land renting system fell into disarray and, by the early 1830&#146;s, 
        the area was overrun by squatters and adjacent legal landowners the hope 
        of permanent settlers along the canal was lost.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">With rental revenues being 
        lost, disputes over property lines and unauthorized settlement by squatters, 
        the board of Ordnance requested a perambulation report (inspection on 
        foot) of the entire 126 miles of the canal. Apart from opening a rent 
        ledger, very little else was <a href="../Image%20Library/Canal/PA134033_Canal_OppositeExhib_1898.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Canal/sm/PA134033_Canal_OppositeExhib_1898_sm.jpg" width="200" height="103" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Another vidw of east bank of Rideau Canal at Exhibition" border="0"></a>accomplished 
        toward controlling settlement. As one Ordnance official put it, more effort 
        was needed to create <i>&quot;a respectable and useful settler in place 
        of the poor and wretched Squatters now infesting the (canal) lands&quot;</i> 
        <b><font size="1">(18)</font></b>. This sad state of affairs continued 
        well into the 1870&#146;s even though the land was eventually turned over 
        to the Dominion Government after Confederation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The relevance of this land 
        saga to our story is that from the early 1830&#146;s to nearly the end 
        of that century, settlement along the Ottawa East section of the canal 
        land consisted of a hodgepodge of development. It was not until the 1860&#146;s 
        that this situation began to be attenuated when the registered plans of 
        subdivision brought a semblance of legal order. In 1873, the Dominion 
        Government reduced the canal reserve land to a 200-foot strip on either 
        side of the waterway (later to become the Driveways); surveyed and sold 
        the remaining land; and ejected all the squatters.</font></p>
