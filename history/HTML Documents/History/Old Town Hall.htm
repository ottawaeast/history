    <td colspan="2">As chronicled in the history chapters, Ottawa East Village 
      came into being in December of 1888 as a result of some fancy footwork by 
      community leaders such as Robert Lees, Archibald Stewart and James Ballantyne 
      as they fended off the covetous city. For the first seven years of existence 
      Ballantyne was the Reeve of the village and by 1894 he felt that the village 
      was financially sound enough to build a town hall. He commissioned his nephew 
      Henry F. Ballantyne, a recent architecture graduate, to draft the plans 
      for a building that would make a statement about the community. James wanted 
      all to know that the village was thriving and planned to be around for a 
      while. 
      <p>Up to that point council had met in the local school or in the parlours 
        of members. It was time for more space. The decision was to purchase land 
        just across the street from Ballantynes home at 54 Main St. Owned by the 
        estate of Robert Lees (who had died in 1893), the village purchased Lot 
        C, Plan 150 from W. A. D. Lees on August 6, 1894 for $450 (LRO - Inst. 
        #132). In September of the following year, council purchased the south 
        half of Lot B from the Lees family for $225 (LRO - Inst. #317). This lot 
        was to later become Montgomery Park.<br>

    <td colspan="2">The building was erected in 1895. Sadly the village records 
      for those years have been lost to time so no information is available regarding 
      the cost or the contractors used in the construction. However, from the 
      labeled photographs taken by Ballantyne himself, it is clear local carpenters 
      and stone masons were used. The land around the building was fenced and 
      used to store wood, equipment and road material such as crushed stone and 
      sand. Around 1902 records indicate that a shed was built to store fire equipment 
      and hoses. 
      <p>Until the end of 1907, when the village was annexed by the city, the 
        building served as a focal point for community business. Administered 
        by Walter S. Barry, the village clerk, it was the place to go to register 
        births, marriages or deaths, submit petitions for drainage work or seek 
        a permit for a pool hall. As the photographs show, it was the headquarters 
        for village elections, plebiscites and a gathering point for village discussion. 
        It must have also been a very cold building as the record shows the clerk 
        being paid 25 cents to light the fire before every meeting. <br>

    <td colspan="2">In January of 1908 the building became the property of the 
      City of Ottawa. From 1908 to 1920 it had various uses including a Baptist 
      Mission and a kindergarten and then it was leased to the Roman Catholic 
      School Board for French instruction. Various reports indicate other uses 
      but no sources are given for these claims. One of the more persistent stories 
      is the renaming of the building as the &quot;Rosedale Community Hall&quot;. 
      It is even reported to have been left vacant from 1920 to 1930 but that 
      is not accurate. Whatever the name or the real story, we do know that eventually 
      it was taken over by the city recreation and parks department. 
      <p>In the early 1950's a playground named Montgomery Park was built on the 
        land adjacent to the building. It consisted of a wading pool, swings and 
        a miniature village of concrete streets with stop signs, a small gazebo-like 
        building with a raised platform (a stage?) and about 6 small brightly 
        painted &quot;houses&quot;, each about 5' x 3' x 4' high. The idea was 
        to provide a little safe community where children could ride their tricycles 
        and play house. It soon became a security nightmare, especially at night, 
        when local teenagers utilized the wee houses to do the things that teenagers 
        do. Within a few short years the &quot;village&quot; was razed.<br>

      for several months. The city designated the property as heritage on April 
      31, 1982 and renovated the structure in 1988. It was officially reopened 
      on with a special ceremony on September 11, 1988. 
      <p>Now known as the Ottawa East Community Center, the grand old building 
        continues to serve as the community's center as it was originally intended 
        to do in 1895. Now under threat (2004) by the proposed expansion of the 
        Queensway located just a few meters to the north, it has become an icon 
        for those who protest the further destruction of Ottawa East &quot;for
