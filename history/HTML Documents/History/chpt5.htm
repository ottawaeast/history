      <p>The Village of Ottawa East officially came into being as a result of 
        County Council motion #27, read a second and third time, on Friday morning, 
        December 7, 1888. With this legislation the tiny community of Archville 
        with a population of fewer than 1,000 people became a incorporated village 
        within the boundaries of Nepean Township.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_Village_letterhead.jpg" width="500" height="131" alt="Village letterhead with W. Barry as clerk"></p>
      <p>Sadly the early village records from 1889 to mid-1898 have been lost 
        to time (<a href="chpt5_miss.htm">See Missing Records</a>) but it is possible 
        to extrapolate some information from scant newspaper coverage and other 
        sources. It is clear that the initial efforts in forming a village administration 
        were led by notables such as the Ballantynes, W. A. D. Lees, George Patterson 
        and others. Given the small tax base and the limited powers within the 
        Township of Nepean, it must have been a formidable task to inaugurate 
        everything from new bylaws to public works. And it must be remembered 
        that while the majority of ratepayers had fought against annexation with 
        the city, they did want certain amenities but not higher taxes. These 
        constraints must have led to some interesting debates at early council 
        meetings!<b><u> </u></b></p>
      <p><b><u>Incorporation Vs Police Village</u></b></p>
      <p>The process of incorporating as a "police village" involved petitioning 
        the county council for the special status. Rayburn in his book "Place 
        Names of Ontario" notes that in the latter part of the Nineteenth Century, 
        this status was given to local communities "for the purpose of establishing 
        fire and safety regulations in built-up areas". The term "police" referred 
        to the "maintenance of a place, as well as the preservation of good order, 
        cleanliness and related matters. Upon designation the village was allowed 
        to elect 3 trustees, improve its streets, erect street lights and perform 
        other public functions" - all at the cost to village ratepayers. This 
        designation conveniently removed a burden from the township as a whole 
        since it did not increase the taxes of rural ratepayers who would not 
        benefit from new village amenities.</p>
      <p>Elliott, in his book "The City Beyond" confirms this definition. He also 
        notes that while the village trustees could assess taxes within their 
        limits for sidewalks, drainage and fire protection; and "contract for 
        such services as garbage collection and street lighting (this was) subject 
        to approval of Nepean Township". However this appears not to have been 
        the case in the Village of Ottawa East by 1898. The earliest existing 
        minutes make no reference to township approval. Moreover, the County Council 
        motion specifically noted that the village would be <a href="Petition_1888.htm">&quot;incorporated&quot;</a>. 
        As the early minutes are missing it is not possible at this point to establish 
        when the incorporation took place but from newspaper accounts it is clear 
        that a functioning village council was active in early 1889.</p>
      <b></b> 
      <p><u><b>An Overview of the Village Circa 1890</b></u>:</p>
      <p>A general description of the village in 1890 begins in the northeast 
        where Second St. (Greenfield) intersected with Hurdman Road, the only 
        route to the city. South, bordered by the Rideau Canal and the railroad 
        (Queensway) was the triangular-shaped Archville. This area was a mix of 
        civil <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Village_1887.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/sm/M_Village_1887_sm.jpg" width="200" height="146" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="3" alt="An 1887 view of the northern part of the village" border="0"></a>servants, 
        tradesman and the odd slaughterhouse. To the east was an industrialized 
        area with brick works and lumberyards in proximity to the rail lines. 
        To the west was the Canal Road with some light industry, market gardens, 
        hotels and some residences. English, Irish, Scots, French Canadians and 
        lots of Germans made up the main mix of the people. An in depth look at 
        the <a href="Germans/Ottawa_East_Germans.htm">German community of Ottawa 
        East can be seen here</a>.</p>
      <p>The concession road (Main St.) bisected this predominantly residential 
        area. Residents named the road <a href="../Image%20Library/Construction/PA133694_Main_Macadam.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Construction/sm/PA133694_Main_Macadam_sm.jpg" width="200" height="135" align="right" alt="Road construction on Main St. at Hawthorne" border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5"></a>after 
        the process of packing stone invented by a Scot named MacAdam &#150; hence 
        the universal term "macadamization". Rather than call it the "Concession 
        Road" (of which there were many in the region), they instead called it 
        the "Macadamized Road", (of which there were also many in the region). 
        Clever people those Ottawa Eastites!</p>
      <p>There was some utility in this naming as revealed by a conversation <a href="../Image%20Library/Construction/PA133670_Main_AtBarretts.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Construction/sm/PA133670_Main_AtBarretts_sm.jpg" width="200" height="140" align="left" alt="Road construction on Main St. at Hawthorne" vspace="5" hspace="5" border="0"></a>between 
        a young Gustave Lemke, a recent German immigrant, and Robert Lees, the 
        venerable and decidedly Scottish village lawyer. Inquiring about an address, 
        Gustave asked in heavily accented English "Ver is Macadam"? Lees replied 
        in his finest burr, "Aye laddie that&#146;d be the one with the stone".</p>
      <p>South of the old Archville, the housing density dropped significantly. 
        Much of the land was held by farmers, land speculators and there were 
        few streets. The large tract of land owned by the Oblates not only housed 
        the Scholaticate but also<a href="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/ssj_17_Schol_convent_wide_revised.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/sm/ssj_17_Schol_convent_wideview_sm.jpg" width="200" height="66" align="right" alt="Early view of Scholasticate and convent - c.1905" vspace="3" hspace="3" border="0"></a> 
        a massive vegetable garden, butcher shop, maple syrup cabin and a cemetery. 
        A daily event in the village was the procession of 30 or 40 student priests 
        as they made their way, dressed in full frock along the Macadamized Road 
        to the Canal Road and then to the University of Ottawa. Twice a day! For 
        a detailed examination of this Ottawa East institution <a href="../../scholasticate.htm">go 
        here</a>.</p>
      <p>At the southern tip of the village was Barney Slattery. Ontario born 
        and a prominent leader in the Irish community, along with his sons William, 
        John, Eddie, Barnard and Gladstone, he <a href="../Image%20Library/Agriculture/PA132294_Slattery_FarmSheep.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Agriculture/sm/PA132294_Slattery_FarmSheep_sm.jpg" width="200" height="113" align="right" border="0" alt="Slattery's sheep pasture with Clegg St. in the background - no date" vspace="5" hspace="5"></a>operated 
        a large farm that specialized in raising beef. On any market day there 
        was a distinct possibility of Slattery driving 50 head of cattle, festooned 
        with banners and bells, up the Macadamized Road through the village and 
        across a bridge which connected to Argyle St. What better way to advertise 
        your product!</p>
      <p>There was employment in the village working for the various local industries 
        but many worked in the city. Getting there was chore at the best of times. 
        With no local transportation, the main mode of commuting was on foot. 
        Imagine living on Clegg St. and slogging through knee-deep snow on a bitter 
        January <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Village_1887_btm.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/sm/M_Village_1887_btm_sm.jpg" width="200" height="237" align="right" alt="The southern part of the village" vspace="5" hspace="5" border="0"></a>morning 
        up the Canal Rd. to the bridge over the canal. There were no sidewalks; 
        or snow removal in that area. In the spring it was mud and in the summer 
        &#150; dust. It is no wonder that a major topic, at almost every council, 
        was sidewalks. </p>
      <p>The village employed many residents, mostly for labour with the odd official 
        position such as constable or assessor. Tenders for the most part were 
        given to locals who almost always had the lowest bid. Perhaps that was 
        the result of many bidders having spent time on council in previous years! 
        While the village had over 1,000 residents, most of the local work (and 
        politics) involved a small cadre of men who had their own personal agendas. 
      </p>
      <p>Just one example of a ratepayer who earned his living in the village 
        is that of Wilhelm Rhomhild. <a href="../Image%20Library/People/X_Romhild_William_c1900.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/People/sm/X_Romhild_William_c1900_sm.jpg" width="95" height="152" align="left" alt="Wilhelm Rhomhild - c1900" vspace="3" hspace="3" border="0"></a>Arriving 
        from Germany in 1888, he quickly learned English and set about to make 
        a living for his family. At any one time, according to the village minutes, 
        he painted the village fire hall, fumigated houses for the Board of Health, 
        broke stone with a hammer for $2.25 per ton, erected street signs and 
        buried dead (hopefully) animals. His most infamous position was that of 
        the Village Constable. A physically powerful man he<a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_Receipt_1905_Romhild_new.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Documents/sm/D_Receipt_1905_Romhild_sm.jpg" width="200" height="299" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="1905 Receipt for Rhomhild to inspect outhouses and bury animals" border="0"></a> 
        had the duty of enforcing council bylaws including the dog tax, for which 
        he received 10% of the money collected. And this was a significant part 
        of his salary given that almost everyone had at least one dog to catch 
        rats and protect property. There were no early morning warm plastic bags 
        in Ballantyne Park &#150; these dogs worked for a living.</p>
      <p> This overview is intended only to put the following topics in a context. 
        The synopsis below represents the life of the village from about 1890 
        to the early part of the Twentieth Century as seen through the eyes of 
        the village council. It reveals a burgeoning, diverse community where 
        hard work, thrift and the future were the mainstays of village life. </p>
      <b></b> 
      <p><u><b>The Village Council</b></u>:</p>
      <p>From 1898 to 1907 the minutes list a council comprised of a reeve and 
        4 councilors. Nominations were held each year in late December with names 
        being put forward by a nominator and seconder. The person had until the 
        day of the election to resign the nomination. Nominations for Public School 
        trustees were also held at that time. Even though there was a Separate 
        School Board (created in 1900), there was never any public election recorded. 
        It appears from the sparse records of this Board that trustees were elected 
        by committee.</p>
      <p><a href="../Image%20Library/People/PA132316.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/People/sm/PA132316sm.jpg" width="200" height="154" align="left" alt="Election Day at the Town Hall" vspace="3" hspace="3" border="0"></a>The 
        election was held in the first week of the following January after the 
        voter&#146;s list had been posted in the village. It appears that the 
        polls were open from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. At the closure of voting the 
        clerk read out the results and declared the winners. The first meeting 
        of council usually took place a few days later in the town hall (completed 
        in 1895).</p>
      <p>Examining 9 years of existing electoral records, it is clear that the 
        political power of the village was held by a small group of men who formed 
        various<a href="../Image%20Library/People/PA133678.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/People/sm/PA133678sm.jpg" width="176" height="128" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="3" alt="Typical election scene in front of Town Hall" border="0"></a> 
        alliances at election time. For example, the election for 1899 had a total 
        of 39 possible names for candidates, nominators and seconders. Only 21 
        individuals were actually involved though (54% of the total possible). 
        Similarly, in 1904 there was a possibility of 54 names yet only 29 were 
        involved (again 54%). </p>
      <p>And of course, there were no women ever involved in the politics of the 
        village. In fact the only few references to women in all of the recorded 
        years involved a few petitions from widows for drains; and those women 
        employed to clean the town hall. (Ed. Note &#150; even the municipal directory 
        from 1877 to about 1900, with a few exceptions, listed only widows. From 
        that point on women began to appear if they had an occupation or lived 
        with a relative at the same address.)</p>
      <b></b> 
      <p><u><b>Village Council Activities</b></u>:</p>
      <p>Council met usually twice a month with special meetings held to discuss 
        major subjects such as school building or major drainage problems. Meetings 
        took place in the evenings as council members worked in daytime.<a href="../Image%20Library/Buildings/Schools/PA132236.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Buildings/Schools/sm/PA132236sm.jpg" width="173" height="179" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="3" alt="SS17 - first school in Ottawa East - built in 1877" border="0"></a> 
        There was no salary or honourarium for council &#150; only the clerk was 
        paid.</p>
      <p>The usual order of business was to first approve the accounts of the 
        village. And every single account, no matter how small, had to be recorded 
        and approved by a motion. The complete accounts for <a href="chpt5_1899.htm">1899</a> 
        and <a href="chpt5_1906.htm">1906</a> can be found in the yearly summaries 
        that follow this introduction. </p>
      <p>Next on the agenda were the various letters sent and received by council. 
        By way of a motion or directive, the clerk would be authorized to reply 
        to the various communications received. Council also administered policies 
        via the mail directing the clerk to write to individuals or agencies requesting 
        compliance with council&#146;s wishes. </p>
      <p>By far the single most important topic discussed at council was that 
        of public works. Council regularly received "petitions" from ratepayers 
        requesting such things as drainage or sidewalks. Upon approval, tenders 
        would be requested for labour and/or materials. The lowest tender was 
        always accepted and work would commence under the direction of a committee 
        of councilors.</p>
      <p>About June each year council would hold a "Court of Revision" with a 
        jury where ratepayers could request a lowering of their tax assessment 
        or school support designation. Individuals in most cases were given some 
        relief but large organizations such as the railway or Telephone Company 
        never had their assessment reduced. For a small village the Canada Atlantic 
        Railway must have been a cash cow! After revision the mill rate would 
        be set for payments to the county, schools and village expenses including 
        bank debentures for building such things as the town hall.</p>
      <b></b> 
      <p><u><b>Appointments</b></u>:</p>
      <p>Council had the yearly duty of making several appointments to positions 
        necessary for the operation of the village. Early on each year two auditors 
        would be appointed (one by the reeve) to review the previous years accounts. 
        In 1899 the fee for each auditor was $3.00/year; by 1906 it was $10.00. 
      </p>
      <p>R. Robinson filled the position of Tax Assessor in 1899 and was paid 
        $40 for the year to both assess and collect the taxes. By 1906 the annual 
        fee for just the Assessor was $75. In that year George Patterson was appointed 
        Tax Collector at $85/year with the requirement that he post of a bond 
        of $500 to guarantee the village would receive the money. An interesting 
        note regarding this position was the rather slipshod procedure for records. 
        Throughout the existing records there are numerous references to tax records 
        not handed in and council refusing to pay for services. For example, J. 
        Bower was finally paid $40 for his 1895 services as Tax Collector in February 
        of 1899.</p>
      <p>Council was also responsible for appointing the members of the Board 
        of Health for the village. Terms ranged from one to three years. There 
        was no salary but members did receive payment for special meetings or 
        duties. The Medical Health Officer was appointed after various local doctors 
        were solicited for their terms. Early on in the existing minutes it appears 
        that council was displeased with a Dr. Birkett? and replaced him with 
        Dr. Robinson in 1904 at an annual rate of $60.</p>
      <p>An important appointment was that of Village Constable. In 1899 a bylaw 
        was passed appointing <a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_Receipt_1905_Romhild_new.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Documents/sm/D_Receipt_1905_Romhild_sm.jpg" width="130" height="194" align="left" alt="Receipt for Village Constable - 1905" border="0"></a>Charles 
        Rhomhild to the position. No salary was specified, only that he receive 
        a "reasonable rate" for "every hour that he is actually employed". His 
        duties included not only keeping the peace of the village be he was also 
        responsible for: collecting dog taxes, impounding cattle and horses at 
        large and burying dead animals. He received a percentage of the dog tax 
        and any fines levied in court. In addition: he posted street signs, fumigated 
        houses under the direction of the MHO, inspected outhouses and insured 
        backyards were kept clean. All of this on a part-time basis! By 1903 the 
        constable received $50/year with the additional responsibility of Pound 
        Keeper (essentially the dog pound).</p>
      <p>The position that remained the most consistent was that of the clerk. 
        From 1898 to 1907, Walter N. Barry, an upholsterer living on Seventh St, 
        held the position. He first appears in the municipal directory in 1897 
        and by 1902 he was listed as a foreman at Harris, Campbell and Boyden. 
        His duties as clerk included recording all council matters, at every type 
        of meeting, and dealing with all communications under the direction of 
        council. Some of his minor duties included: purchasing all administrative 
        materials (stamps, stationery, etc.); the registration of all births, 
        deaths and marriages in the village (20 cents each in 1899); and lighting 
        fires in the town hall prior to meetings (25 cents/fire). In 1899 the 
        clerk was paid $16.25 quarterly and by 1906 the salary was $200 per year. 
        He was also the secretary for the Board of Health for which he was paid 
        $5.00 per year.</p>

      <p>The last important position appointed by council was that of the Village 
        Treasurer. In 1899 Andrew G. Acres was appointed at an annual salary of 
        $50. He replaced Thomas Ballantyne who had resigned earlier in the year 
        even though council had asked him to reconsider. Acres was listed in the 
        1898 directory as an hotel clerk living at 10 Seventh St. In 1899 he became 
        an ice dealer and by 1902 he was no longer listed as a village resident. 
        He continued as Treasurer at $50/year until the village was annexed and 
        he prepared the final statement. In all the years he served council never 
        once considered any other person for the job!</p>

      <p><u><b>Public Works</b></u>:</p>
      <p>The majority of council&#146;s time was taken up by this topic and this 
        involved the maintenance of drainage, roads and sidewalks. To accomplish 
        this, the village employed residents as labourers and ordered <a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_Receipt_1905_Ulrich.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Documents/sm/D_Receipt_1905_Ulrich%20sm.jpg" width="134" height="144" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="3" alt="Receipt for Ullrich for breaking stone - 1905" border="0"></a>copious 
        quantities of stone, wood and nails. There were no machines - everything 
        was done by hand, sometimes with the aid of a horse. Labour rates in 1898 
        were $1.25/day for one man working 10 hours; and $2.00/day for a man and 
        a horse. Rubble stone cost $4.50/ton and had to be broken by hand at about 
        $2.25/ton. </p>
      <p>Roads in the village were mainly packed soil. Repairs consisted of filling 
        in the holes with broken stone and grading. Streets had ditches along 
        the sides that constantly plugged with silt leaving large linear ponds 
        of foul, stagnant water. <a href="../Image%20Library/Construction/PA133412.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Construction/sm/PA133412sm.jpg" width="200" height="146" align="left" alt="Rare photo of actual macadamization" vspace="3" hspace="3" border="0"></a>Most 
        people drained their property including the barnyard into these ditches. 
        Only the Macadamized Road (Main St..) was maintained with a packed stone 
        surface. In certain locations proper culverts were installed with pipe 
        and covered by "gully grates" to permit crossing.</p>
      <p>Sidewalks were made of thick cedar planks laid down in specific lengths 
        on poles set on a bed of stone. Various tenders show that the planks had 
        to be 3 inches thick and 3 feet long (no mention of width)<a href="../Image%20Library/General/PA131969.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/General/sm/PA131969sm.jpg" width="177" height="130" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="3" alt="Main St. sidewalk c1895" border="0"></a>. 
        These planks were nailed to 9-foot cedar poles that had a minimum diameter 
        of 6 inches at the smallest end. In 1898 poles cost 16 cents each and 
        contractors were paid 20 cents/section for installation. In 1903 the village 
        offered residents new "granolithic" sidewalks. This was essentially cement. 
        The catch was that the majority of ratepayers on each street had to agree 
        as they paid the cost per foot.</p>
      <p>Snow removal was a labour intensive job to say the least. By 1902 it 
        <a href="../Image%20Library/Buildings/PA132337.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Buildings/sm/PA132337%20sm.jpg" width="175" height="127" align="left" vspace="3" hspace="5" alt="Typical snow conditions" border="0"></a>appears 
        that snow had become a major item with council. It is doubtful that all 
        the roads were cleared as people would walk or drive their sleighs over 
        the packed snow. Labour was probably used to clean the existing sidewalks 
        and a few main roads. Some examples of cost included: Michael Redmond 
        paid $7.28 for 48.5 hours of snow cleaning at 15 cents/hour; and J. C. 
        Ogilvie who earned $11.13 for work with a horse (44.5 hours at 25 cents/hour). 
        By 1904 the village employed 21 men and boys in January. Men received 
        15 cents while boys were paid 8 cents per hour. The village even purchased 
        a horse-drawn snow plow that year.</p>
      <p>Permanent sewers did not exist until 1904. Up to that time residents 
        (and industries) drained their <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Map_Sewers_1903.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/sm/M_Map_Sewers_1903_sm.jpg" width="126" height="200" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Map submitted to Federal Government for lease of Ordnance land" border="0"></a>property 
        into the roadside ditches. There is some mention in the minutes of residents 
        along the canal discharging their wastewater directly into the waterway. 
        As there was no village water system, pit privies (outhouses) were de 
        rigueur. Some industries such as slaughterhouses dumped directly into 
        the Rideau River.</p>
      <p>As the village grew the need for a proper sewage system became critical. 
        Finally in 1903 ratepayers agreed to a debenture that would fund a main 
        trunk sewer with individual property owners paying for their own connections. 
        There was no sewage treatment of course. The village did what all municipalities 
        did at the time &#150; they piped it directly into the Rideau River (at 
        Springhurst). More on this can be found in the yearly summaries.</p>
      <p>The absence of a village water system until 1904 was a major concern 
        for council. With the use of pit privies and backyard wells, the threat 
        of groundwater contamination was always present. As well, the <img src="../Image%20Library/Documents/sm/D_OE_Water_Co_Logo.jpg" width="389" height="28" align="right" alt="Ottawa East Water Compmy Logo">village 
        did not have a source of pressurized water to fight fires. There had been 
        some rumblings of a water system in 1898 but nothing came of it. Finally 
        in 1903, several residents, including such village stalwarts as Ballantyne, 
        Lees and Slattery, banded together to form the Ottawa East Water Co. Within 
        a year the company had installed electric pumps to draw groundwater<a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_WATER_BILL.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Documents/sm/D_Water_top_sm.jpg" width="150" height="69" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Top portion of 1905 Village water bill" border="0"></a> 
        (the Rideau River was deemed too polluted) and installed a system of pipes 
        with fire hydrants. Annual rates for individual homes ranged from $5 to 
        $10 with an extra 50 cents if a cow was owned. For the actual rate charged 
        in 1905, <a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_Water_Sched_Rates.jpg">go 
        here</a>. There is more on this interesting story in the 1903 yearly summary.</p>
      <p align="left">The village had access to electric power in the late 1890&#146;s 
        as evidenced by the regular electrical bill paid <a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_Agreement_Electric_1905_new.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Documents/sm/D_Agreement_Electric_1905sm.jpg" width="150" height="66" align="left" alt="Village contract with electric company c1905" vspace="5" hspace="5" border="0"></a>for 
        the town hall. But there was no street lighting (not even gas). In January 
        of 1903 council passed Bylaw #79 which gave the exclusive right to supply 
        electrical power to the village to the Ottawa Electric Company. As part 
        of the agreement, the company installed a system of wires and street lamps 
        on the main streets at key intersections. From that point on there were 
        constant demands on council from the ratepayers to extend the system. 
        Electricity rates for the average person at that time are shown below.</p>

      <p><u><b>Council Motions and Bylaws</b></u>:</p>
      <p>Appointments and debentures always required a bylaw and most dealt with 
        such mundane topics as drainage or street openings. Every year there was 
        an ongoing debate with the railways involving excess train whistling or 
        track crossings. Council reacted to such topics with stern motions and 
        letters to the offending parties. On a more colourful note, in 1903 council 
        decided to clean up the morals of the village and passed Bylaw #90 which 
        involved all sorts of nuisances and immoralities. With this new law it 
        became illegal for example: to wash private parts in public places; expose 
        wounds or deformities to obtain alms; or operate a pool hall. There is 
        much more on this infamous bylaw in the yearly summary.</p>
      <p>Life in the Village of Ottawa East during this time was very similar 
        to most of the suburbs surrounding the city. The ratepayers constantly 
        petitioned the council for improvements to the basic amenities of roads, 
        sewers and protection of their property. In the end it was the absence 
        of an adequate fire department that tipped the balance and prompted a 
        slim majority of villagers to vote for annexation with the city. But it 
        was the hard work of the village council from 1889 to 1907 that created 
        a community that was characterized by the City of Ottawa Annexation Committee 
        as being "a very desirable acquisition". The final financial statement 
        of the village showed that the assets exceeded the liabilities. While 
        the community lost its autonomy as it joined the city, the spirit persisted 
        and exists even today!</p>
