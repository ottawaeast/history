      Presbyterians from the northeast of Ireland. They were certainly not wealthy 
      and were attracted to this area where available land was cheaper than in 
      other parts of the township. In the late 1840&#146;s more land became available

      <p>It is important at this point in the story to note that the City of Ottawa 
        proper stopped at the southern boundary of Gladstone/Mann Avenues (<a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Suburbs_taylor.jpg">See 
        Map</a>). Everything south of that east to west line was technically a 
        suburb. While the City continued to evolve from a commercial/sawmilling 
        function to a civil service center, the surrounding areas developed as 
        separate and distinct communities initially created by land speculators. 
        The economic success of these communities was largely dependent on access 
        to the City, via available transportation, for the sale of goods, produce 
        and employment. While distinct politically, the prosperity of the suburbs 
        (including the Ottawa East area) was dependent on the larger city.</p>
      <p>As with other communities such as Rochesterville, Hintonburg, Mount Sherwood, 
        the area that was to become Ottawa East Village began to develop its own 
        unique character. To describe the aerial extent of our story, it is best 
        to follow the structure presented by the original land survey that sectioned 
        the region into Concessions and Lots. Of particular interest are the Concessions 
        of C and D and Lots F to L. Using present-day roads, Concession C is bounded 
        by Bronson Avenue in the west and Main St. in the east. Concession D is 
        bounded in the west by Main St. and in the east by the Rideau River.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Conc_lots_base.jpg" width="500" height="355"></p>
      <p>The northern boundary of Lot F is the east/west line of Gladstone and 
        Mann Avenues. All the remaining lots (G to L) are lettered south from 
        here. </p>
      <b></b> 
      <p><u><b>Lot &quot;F&quot;</b></u> &#150; Bordered by Bronson Ave., Gladstone/Mann 
        Avenues, Rideau River and Isabella Street.</p>
      <p><img src="../Image%20Library/People/CA28020_Stewart_William_new.jpg" width="199" height="287" align="left" alt="A young William Stewart about 1850">Circa 
        1850, the land immediately south of the future City of Ottawa was that 
        owned by William Stewart &#150; the grandfather of Ottawa East. Stewart 
        wore many hats during his time in the area. Originally from Scotland, 
        he was a merchant when he first arrived in Bytown. He quickly became one 
        of the most influential men in the community through his duties as a land 
        agent, lumberman, landlord, president of the county agricultural society, 
        Assemblyman and leading member of St. Andrew&#146;s Presbyterian Church. 
        There is much more on the Stewart Family and Stewarton located <u><a href="../../notables.htm">here</a></u>.</p>
      <p>In 1834 he purchased 200 acres from a Loyalist speculator who had received 
        the land as a grant from the Crown and had left it undeveloped. Identified 
        as Lot F, Concession C, this land is now surrounded by Bronson Ave., Isabella 
        St., Gladstone Ave., and the Rideau Canal. Later, in 1844, according to 
        land records, he was granted an additional 104 acres of the Lot F in Conc. 
        D. This adjoined his holdings to the east across the canal.</p>
      <p>In 1852, when Bytown residents began to lobby the Legislature for city 
        status, Stewart appealed to the local council for exclusion of his property. 
        He pleaded that:</p>
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <p><i>&quot;the present limit of the town is large enough for the next 
            half century . . . there are upwards of a thousand acres of land now 
            within the town without being occupied by one building . . . nearly 
            two hundred acres of (my) land (is) under original forest [and] . 
            . . it would be unjust and exceedingly oppressive to assess such unproductive 
            property at City of Town valuation&quot;</i> <b><font size="1">(2)</font></b>. 
          </p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p>As a result of his influential lobbying, in 1855 when Ottawa officially 
        became a city, the southern line was fixed at the northern boundary of 
        his land (Ann Street, later to become Gladstone and Mann Avenues).</p>
      <p>William Stewart's prediction of a lapse of 50 years before the land would 
        be needed was not to prove <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Reg_Plan_48_new.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/sm/M_Reg_Plan_48_header_sm.jpg" width="163" height="143" align="right" border="0" alt="Title Portion of Registered Plan for Archville"></a>out. 
        After his death ownership of 86 acres of his holdings between the canal 
        and the Rideau River in Lot F passed to his son Archibald in 1873. The 
        son did not waste time! By the end of that year Archie registered a plan 
        of subdivision (<a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Reg_Plan_48_new.jpg">Reg. 
        Plan 48</a>) named <b>Archville West</b> and immediately offered lots 
        for sale. This was the very beginning of the future Ottawa East Village.</p>
      <br>
      <p><u><b>Lot &quot;G&quot;</b></u> &#150; bordered by the Queensway (approximately) 
        and Springhurst Avenue.</p>
      <p>South of the Stewart holdings was Lot G in both Concessions C and D. 
        The dividing line between these two concessions was a road allowance that 
        was later to become Main Street. Lot G, Conc. C was <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_oe_map_1879.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/sm/M_oe_map_1879_sm.jpg" width="171" height="156" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Ottawa East area land holdings in 1879" border="0"></a>originally 
        owned by George Patterson (of Patterson Creek fame), and later by John 
        Hickey and William Powell (Powell Ave.). The majority of the land was 
        leased to individual market gardeners and there was very little development 
        in the 1850&#146;s and 60&#146;s. But the land in Lot G, east of the canal, 
        soon became important due to its proximity to Lower Town. To understand 
        this new importance, it is necessary to review the transportation geography 
        of this specific area. </p>
      <p>Up until the building of the Rideau Canal, the only road available for 
        north-south transportation was a &#145;forced&#146; road (following the 
        shape of the land, not survey lines). This ran from the Ottawa River at 
        the Chaudi&egrave;re Falls, south around the northern extent of Dow&#146;s 
        Great Swamp (later Dow&#146;s lake) to the Rideau River opposite Braddish 
        Billings&#146; farm across the river in Gloucester Township. As the canal 
        cut this road in 1830 a new bridge was needed. It was decided however 
        to utilize the cleared land along the canal for a more useful road. A 
        new road was then cut from what is today Billings Bridge, along the future 
        course of Riverdale Avenue to the eastern bank of the canal at approximately 
        Bristol Ave. and then on to Lower Town. This rerouting of traffic was 
        to prove highly advantageous for the later development of Ottawa East 
        as this road remained the main route between Gloucester and the city will 
        into the 1860&#146;s.</p>
      <p>After Ottawa became a city in 1855, the land east of the canal in Lot 
        G became of interest particularly to <a href="../Image%20Library/Buildings/CA5798_Ogara_House.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Buildings/sm/CA5798_Ogara_House_sm.jpg" width="150" height="103" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="O'Gara house on Main St." align="left" border="0"></a>lawyers 
        as the canal road allowed easy access to the court building in Lower Town. 
        In 1859, William Ring and C. J. O&#146;Connor (O&#146;Connor St.) purchased 
        12 acres of this land. O&#146;Connor subdivided part of the land into 
        lots but was unsuccessful in attracting buyers. The northern part was 
        given over for taxes and in 1866, the fiery Ottawa magistrate Martin O&#146;Gara 
        purchased it. Today this land is bounded (approximately) by Hawthorne 
        Avenue, Main St., just south of Graham Ave. and the canal. The southern 
        part of Lot G was purchased by John Graham <a href="../Image%20Library/Buildings/CA5775_Graham_Alex_House.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Buildings/sm/CA5775_Graham_Alex_House_sm.jpg" width="200" height="133" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="The Graham house, 45 Main St., also known as Ardagh Square.

        Ave.), who owned the Albion Hotel across from the court house in Lower 
        Town. Canadian Martyrs Church and Immaculata High School today occupy 
        this land.</p>

        Conc. D, Lot G, Crown Attorney Robert Lees began buying property in 1859 
        along with T. Kealey, J. Greaves and others. Lees was to become one of 
        the most important figures in the evolution of Ottawa East. His political 
        say and vision for the land saved the area from being annexed by the city 
        in 1888 and to a great extent, he guided the <a href="../Image%20Library/Buildings/X__Wildwood.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Buildings/sm/X__Wildwood_sm.jpg" width="150" height="106" align="right" alt="The home of Robert Lees - no date. He built the home in the 1860's and called in &quot;Wildwood&quot; since it was located in the wild woods outside the city." vspace="5" hspace="5" border="0"></a>development 
        of Ottawa East. Sadly the beautiful brick home he built in 1863 was torn 
        down in the early 1960&#146;s to accommodate the Queensway.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In the early 1860&#146;s, the Ottawa East land south of the city was 
        fundamentally a rural neighbourhood populated by farmers and labouring 
        families. Lees, in a desire to escape urban life, had built his home in 
        a forest and aptly named it Wildwood. Apart from agrarian practices, there 
        was very little in the way of commercial activity. One exception was a 
        crude tavern, run by a black American Henry Westbrook, located on the 
        eastern bank of the canal at present-day Clegg St. <b><font size="1">(3)</font></b>.<b></b> 
      </p>
      <p><u><b>Lot &quot;H&quot;</b></u> &#150; Northern boundary in Conc. C is 
        Glebe Ave. and the southern boundary is Fifth Ave. In Conc. D, the northern 
        boundary is approximately where Oblate St. intersects with Main St. and 
        along the southern limit of the Immaculate High School land. The southern 
        line of this lot is Clegg St.<a href="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/ssj_17_Schol_convent_wide_revised.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/sm/ssj_17_Schol_convent_wideview_sm.jpg" width="200" height="66" align="right" border="0" alt="Scholaticate and convent - 1903 to 1915"></a></p>
      <p>John Fitzsimmons originally owned this lot in Conc. D. In 1863 the majority 
        of the land was sold to the Roman Catholic College of St. Joseph. Later 
        this land was to become St. Joseph&#146;s Scholasticate of the Oblate 
        Order and St. Paul&#146;s University. Fitzsimmons retained the northwestern 
        corner of the lot for later development as residential property. This 
        may explain the curious little string of homes between Springhurst and 
        Oblate Streets nearly surrounded by a massive Catholic complex.</p>
      <p>Across the street from the Catholic holdings in Lot H, Conc. C, the land 
        was owned by another powerful religious denomination &#150; the Presbyterians!</p>
      <p><a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_1828_map_new.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/sm/M_1828_map_sm.jpg" width="200" height="165" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Notice that the Clergy Reserve extends across the canal into Ottawa East. Therefore the &quot;Glebe&quot; was acutally part of Ottawa East in the beginning!" border="0"></a>As 
        described in the last chapter, when the Crown originally divided the land 
        of Nepean Township, one-seventh of the area was reserved for the Protestant 
        Church. This was known as a clergy reserve (or a Glebe in the English 
        parlance). It was intended to serve as a source of revenue in support 
        of the church. Originally this referred to the Anglicans (Church of England) 
        but this caused a storm of protest from other denominations. This struggle 
        between the &quot;Church of the Empire&#146; and the Scotch Presbyterians 
        is a complex one, but for our purposes, it is sufficient here to note 
        that on: </p>

      <p>Therein lies the derivation of the name of one of Ottawa&#146;s most 
        desirable neighbourhoods.</p>

        recipient of this valuable tract of land was St. Andrew&#146;s Presbyterian 
        Church (still standing at the corner of Wellington and Kent Streets). 
        Very little was done with this land until 1868 when the church&#146;s 
        &#145;temporal committee&quot; &quot;divided the Glebe west of the Canal 
        into 15 garden plots of about 10 acres each and let them to tenants&quot; 
        <b><font size="1">(5)</font></b>. When a local speculator attempted to 
        purchase the Glebe lots in 1885, business-minded members of the congregation 
        were spurred to increase the development of the church land. Accordingly 
        a plan of <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Reg_Plan_102_new.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/sm/M_Reg_Plan_102_title_sm.jpg" width="269" height="127" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Title of Reg. Plan 102 - click to enlarge" border="0"></a>subdivision 
        (Reg. Plan #102) was registered on December 13, 1888. This created, on 
        paper at least, the Village of Spenceville named after the Reverend Alexander 
        Spence (shown on the left); minister of St. Andrew&#146;s from 1848 to 
        1867 <b><font size="1">(6)</font></b>. It was well into the Twentieth 
        Century before the last piece of land in Ottawa East owned by the church 
        was sold. To be technical then, a significant portion of the Glebe was 
        actually part of the Village of Ottawa East!</p>
      <b></b> 
      <p><u><b>Lot I</b></u> &#150; Northern boundary is Clegg St. and the southern 
        boundary is approximately an east to west line along the back of the lots 
        on Elliott St. This line is projected from the canal to the Rideau River.</p>
      <p>Moving still further south, the land was decidedly rural with the vast 
        majority of the area owned by a few farmers and the Mutchmor Family. In 
        Conc. D, (to the east of Main St.) all of the land was owned by John Fitzsimmons. 
        Very little has been found regarding this family.</p>
      <p>This lot in Conc. C extended from the road allowance (Main St.) in the 
        east to Bronson Ave. in the west. Originally owned by the Fraser Family, 
        the land was acquired by the John Mutchmor Family in 1836 <b><font size="1">(7)</font></b> 
        from William Vancamp. This family and relatives were to play a major role 
        in the development of land along Bank St. and later in Ottawa South with 
        the establishment of Rideauville. Originally the Mutchmors had little 
        success at farming this land and left the Ottawa region for the United 
        States in 1839 <b><font size="1">(8)</font></b>. But when Ottawa was announced 
        as the new capital, the family saw the value of their land increase and 
        returned in 1861 <b><font size="1">(9)</font></b>. In 1864 they divided 
        their holdings on both sides of the canal into blocks which were used 
        initially by &quot;gardeners and nurserymen <b><font size="1">(10)</font></b>. 
      </p>
      <p>Early maps show that some of this land was owned by Bates but again, 
        no information on this person has been found to date.</p>
      <p><b><u>Lots K and L &#150; </u></b></p>
      <p>Technically the description of the area that was to become Ottawa East 
        Village should end here. The legal southern boundary of the village is 
        the line between Lots I and K. Specifically this line would be found at 
        the back of the properties on the north side of Elliot St. Therefore any 
        land south of this line may be more properly classified as Ottawa South. 
      </p>
      <p>But historical geography rarely matches lot lines. Therefore the story 
        will continue south, down Main St. to the Smyth Road Bridge at the Rideau 
        River. Should anyone take personal umbrage with the decision, this writer 
        is prepared to meet that person, &#145;con las pistolas&#146;, at dawn 
        on any day, at the original site of the Ottawa East Village Water Department 
        Pumping Station.</p>
      <p>As well, the small sliver of land along the canal opposite Lansdowne 
        Park will be included. The reader will discover that the geographic proximity 
        of these two areas to the later Ottawa East Village requires that they 
        be examined in the context of our story, notwithstanding the survey lines.</p>
      <p>Lot K, Conc. D was owned originally by William Powell who acquired the 
        land from the Crown in 1869 (Land Records &#150; Conc. D &#150; Vol.#7). 
        William Slattery, a wealthy farmer and butcher purchased the land in 1872; 
        and maintained extensive pasture land in the area. Not only was he one 
        of the first importers of western beef but he was also instrumental in 
        advancing animal husbandry in Nepean Township. <a href="../Image%20Library/Buildings/X_Slattery_house.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Buildings/sm/X_Slattery_house%20sm.jpg" width="150" height="114" align="right" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="Slattery House on Riverdale at Main" border="0"></a>The 
        Slattery Family continued to farm this land long after being surrounded 
        by residential areas in the Twentieth Century. The house shown here <b><font size="1">(11)</font></b> 
        was located just to the west of what is now the Cuban Embassy. It was 
        lost to fire in the 1990&#146;s.</p>
      <p>To the west of the concession dividing line (Main St.) were the extensive 
        holdings of Lewis Williams (mentioned earlier). One of the original settlers, 
        he came to the area in 1817 with his wife, 4 sons and 2 daughters <b><font size="1">(12)</font></b>. 
        His original house at 96 Southern Drive still stands. In 1874 the farm 
        was divided with 54 acres sold in the western part. This later became 
        Rideauville. He also attempted to speculate in the late 1870's laying 
        out a &quot;subdivision of his own at the Fairburn farm just north of 
        Billings Bridge <b><font size="1">(13)</font></b>, but it was unsuccessful. 
        There is more on the Williams family in the Notables section located <a href="../../notables.htm">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Lot L presents some difficulty in delineating which parts were more connected 
        with Ottawa East than with Ottawa South. An <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Williams_map_1828.jpg">1828 
        map</a> <b><font size="1">(14)</font></b> drawn for Col. By shows the 
        entire lot being owned by Lewis Williams from what is now Bronson Ave. 
        to the Rideau River. Essentially it represents only a tiny piece of land 
        where the west end of Rideau Gardens Drive is today.</p>
      <p>From Lots F to L, in Concessions C and D, the stage was set for the next 
        period of Ottawa East&#146;s evolution. All the constituent parts were 
        in place for the coalescence of a new community as Ottawa became the Nation&#146;s 
        capital. The expected land boom of the late 1860&#146;s and 1870&#146;s 
        throughout the region was to have a marked effect on the Village.</p>
