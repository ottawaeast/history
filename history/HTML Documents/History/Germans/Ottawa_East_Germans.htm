      C. Clemow <font size=2>(2)</font>, later to become a Senator (Clemow Avenue).

      <p>It appears, as described in government correspondence at the time, that 
        Germans were highly sought after to occupy the sparsely settled areas 
        in Canada. In 1862, a letter to P. M. Vankoughnet, Commissioner of Crown 
        Lands, from William Wagner Esq., the Provincial Land Surveyor who had 
        just been sent to Germany to recruit immigrants, noted that</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><i>"Those emigrants chiefly fit for our climate and from clearing Canadian 
          woods are those living in the eastern part of German in quarters which 
          have only been cleared during the last century . . . (in) the Provinces 
          of West Prussia, Pomerania, Posen, Silesia and the eastern part of Brandenburg. 
          Here lives a people used to tearing out the stumps of trees from soil 
          (3).</i></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>From this letter it is clear that the initial immigration from Germany 
        was focused on providing agricultural settlers to open public lands. In 
        1861, Clemow was replaced in Ottawa by William John Wills, who served 
        as the Immigration Agent until 1894 <font size=2>(4)</font>. It was under 
        his direction and encouragement that the German community was established 
        in the Ottawa area.</p>
      <p>Excerpts from Wills' 1864 report described a highly desirable situation 
        for immigrants coming to the Ottawa area. He noted that</p>
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <p><i>"Here in the city, the construction of public buildings afforded 
            a field for all mechanics and such of the labouring class who desired 
            to secure such situations . . . So great was the demand for imported 
            labor that orders were always received from applicants in anticipation 
            of the arrival of emigrants . . . (and new construction) will cause 
            increased demand for stone-cutters, masons, bricklayers and carpenters 
            . . . it may be reasonably anticipated emigrants and capitalists will 
            be induced to seek a resident in close proximity to the capital of 
            the country" </i><font size=2>(5).</font></p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p>As will be seen later, this report accurately predicted what was to occur 
        as the community of Ottawa East became established. It was the Germans 
        who settled here, that provided a large portion of the labour needed to 
        build Ottawa.</p>
      <p>Throughout the 1860's and 1870's a steady flow of German immigrants arrived 
        in Canada. As detail in Thomas W. Carkner's definitive work "Ottawa Germania" 
        (the principal source for this chapter), the majority of newly-arrived 
        Germans that came to the region, settled in the city proper. It must be 
        remembered that Ottawa East at that time was still a tiny community with 
        little housing.</p>
      <p>Those Germans that did settle in Ottawa, became a base for a community 
        that was to rapidly grow in the next decade. Immigration in the 1870's 
        slowed considerably as a result of a world-wide depression. With a reduction 
        in trade there were fewer opportunities for employment and less money 
        to fund immigration. For the most part those who did emigrate from Germany 
        did so as a result of "chain migration" whereby immigrants already established 
        in Canada sent money to assist family and friends in joining them in the 
        new country. A further impediment to German migration came from the German 
        government itself. Alarmed by the increasing tide of their citizens departing 
        the "Vaterland", Berlin took steps to discourage people from leaving including 
        arresting Canadian emigration agents working in Germany.</p>
      <p>In the early 1880's there was a "new optimism and renewed immigration 
        to the city of Ottawa"<font size=2>(6)</font>. The <a href="../../Image%20Library/People/X_Romhild_William_c1900.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/People/sm/X_Romhild_William_c1900_sm.jpg" width="150" height="240" align="right" alt="William Rhomhild - c1900" border="0"></a>grip 
        of the depression had lessened and the economy of Ottawa was flourishing. 
        W. J. Wills, head of the Ottawa Agency for immigration hired Carl Maass, 
        recently arrived in Ottawa, as an interpreter. This action had a pronounced 
        effect on enticing German immigrants to settle in Ottawa as his brother 
        Wilhelm, back in Germany, had taken on a major role in recruiting people 
        to come to Canada. This provided the Ottawa German community with "a unique 
        advantage when it came to arranging to bring out their family and friends"<font size=2>(7)</font>. 
        As will be seen later, this action altered the ethnic mix of the Ottawa 
        East community.</p>
      <p>The number of Germans arriving in the Ottawa Valley grew steadily from 
        1879 to a "peak in 1884"<font size=2>(8)</font>. Some of the reasons for 
        this were noted in the Ottawa Citizen in January of 1882 that contained 
        an interview with W. J. Wills. In the article he was quoted as saying</p>
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <p><i>"A great many German families come out chiefly from two causes, 
            some to join relatives, others were induced to come through literature 
            sent home by my interpreter Mr. Mass (sic), to parties in Germany. 
            I may say that we get no better class of settler than those"</i> <font size=2>(9)</font>. 
          </p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p>The Maass brother's connection was obviously working! </p>
      <p><a href="../../Image%20Library/People/X_Romhild_Bertha_neeCornelius.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/People/sm/X_Romhild_Bertha_neeCornelius_sm.jpg" width="150" height="197" align="left" alt="Bertha Romhild - (nee Cornelius) - c.1900 -wife of Wilhelm" border="0"></a>John 
        Dyke, the Liverpool Immigration Agent tasked with assisting immigrants 
        to Canada, offered a further viewpoint as to why so many Germans emigrated 
        and were successful in Canada. In his annual report of 1885, to the Canadian 
        High Commissioner in London, England, he had several observations on conditions 
        in Germany and the success of Germans compared to immigrants from the 
        British Isles. He noted that</p>
      <dir> 
        <dir> <i> 
          <p>"No emigrants make better settlers than the Germans . . . no nationality 
            is so soon merged in that of their adopted country . . . than the 
            hardy Teuton . . . (and) the bulk of emigration comes from West Prussia, 
            Posen, Pomerania and Mecklenburg, purely agricultural districts where 
            the lowest wages are now being paid".</p>
          </i> 
          <p><i>"The principal reason of the German's success, as compared with 
            the Englishman's is that, although he may meet with the greatest difficulties 
            to be found in Canada, he is far better off than when in his own country 
            for a labourer in England will earn three times as much wages as one 
            in Germany. The German, moreover, is much more content with small 
            beginnings than his fellow emigrant from the British Isles . . . (and 
            he) is far more valuable than the English settler, as he sends for 
            his family"</i><font size=2>(10)</font>.</p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p>There was a significant decrease in general immigration beginning in 
        1885 with the onset of another world-wide depression. But the Ottawa German 
        community continued to grow through 1887 <font size=2>(11)</font> as a<a href="../../Image%20Library/People/X_Romhild_Robert_2.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/People/sm/X_Romhild_Robert_2_sm.jpg" width="150" height="195" align="left" alt="Robert Romhild and wife - c.1900" border="0"></a> 
        direct result of "chain migration". By 1888 the great boom of German migration 
        to Ottawa was over and through the 1890's declined to a much slower pace. 
        The reasons for the decline were mainly related to another depression 
        and a change in priorities for the Canadian government. Support for immigration 
        was directed away from Ottawa to the western provinces where there was 
        a much greater need for settlement.</p>
      <p>But as the 1901 Census reveals, the immigration boom of the 1880's and 
        early 1890's had served to create a flourishing German community in Ottawa, 
        and in particular, the Village of Ottawa East.</p>
      <b><font size=4> 
      <p align="CENTER">The Germans of Ottawa East - 1871 to 1901</p>
      </font></b> 
      <p>The 1864 prediction by W. J. Wills that many German immigrants would 
        settle close to Ottawa and seek employment in the building trades was 
        spot on. As the <u><a href="../../Databases/German_Table_1871_01.htm">table 
        here</a></u> indicates, the vast majority of the Germans who settles in 
        Ottawa East worked as labourers, brick makers, carpenters, stone masons 
        and painters with most others in service industries.</p>
      <p>The first recorded German immigrant in Ottawa East was William Taratset. 
        The 1881 Census lists him as a butcher (born in 1843), living with his 
        wife Catherine (b. 1841) and his children William E., Henry A., Alex H., 
        and Godfrey, all born in Canada. He is however, not listed in any of the 
        municipal directories so his stay in Ottawa East was brief. The first 
        resident of Ottawa East of German origin was Horace O'Dell (born in the 
        USA) who started the O'Dell Brickworks here and is described elsewhere 
        in this history.</p>
      <p>Initially most German immigrants arrived as unskilled labour "employed 
        in jobs at the bottom of the economic scale" <font size=2>(13)</font> 
        that nobody else wanted. With large families to support and no social 
        safety net to rely on, these industrious, hardworking 'Teutons' rarely 
        turned down an opportunity to better themselves. Perhaps one of the best 
        examples of their work ethic can be seen in the occupation of 'stone breaking'.</p>
      <p>As the city grew so did the demand for better roads. Ratepayers were 
        no longer content with packed soil as a road surface as it suffered the 
        vagaries of climate and made travel difficult. The demand now was for 
        hard-packed surfaces of stone. The process of building this type of surface 
        was known as "macadamization'' after the Scottish inventor John MacAdam. 
        Essential to this process, as well as other types of public works, was 
        a steady supply of broken stone. In the absence of a mechanical stone 
        crusher, the city employed labourers to break rock by hand.</p>
      <p>There was a stigma however, associated with this basic work. Many unemployed 
        men felt that this occupation was "not just suitable" as reported in the 
        Ottawa Citizen in April of 1877 <font size=2>(14)</font>.<font size=2> 
        </font>The article noted that a number of men seeking work from the City 
        Engineer declined the work offered. "One man said he was not born to break 
        stones and he wasn't going to take any mean advantage of nature because 
        he happened to be a little hard up" <font size=2>(15)</font>. There was 
        addition reticence associated with this occupation for many since stone 
        breaking was a form of punishment meted out to prisoners held in the County 
        Jail. For many therefore, this work was either too hard or better left 
        to unemployed immigrants. And that was just fine for the newly arrived 
        Germans.</p>
      <p>In his book Carkner details numerous contracts given by the City to German 
        immigrants. In July of 1873, Henry Haul received $1,037 for breaking 122 
        toise (tons) of stone at $8.50 per ton. With additional contracts he broke 
        over 138 tons which amounted to "a block of stone that is 30 feet long, 
        30 feet wide and 33 feet high"<font size=2>(16)</font>. It is quite logical 
        to conclude, as Carkner does, that Haul employed many of his fellow immigrants 
        to accomplish this work.</p>
      <p>Obtaining employment in public works was essential to the Germans in 
        the Ottawa area. So much so that in 1890 the topic created a political 
        furor in the newly incorporated Village of Ottawa East. In a December 
        17, 1890 article in the Ottawa Free Press, entitled "German Voters Kicking", 
        it was reported that </p>
      <dir> 
        <dir> 
          <p><i>"about forty German voters in the village . . . are enraged at 
            their recent dismissal from work on the Rideau St. drain. . . (having 
            been) refused work under the corporation owing to living outside the 
            city and they are agitating for incorporation of the village with 
            the city"</i><font size=2>(17)</font>. </p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p>In the village itself, much of the work on roads, drainage and building 
        repair was done by Germans residing in the community. The rate of pay 
        however was decidedly lower than that paid by the city.</p>
      <p>As seen in Chapter Five, day-labour and contract work were regularly 
        given to men such as Lemke, Ullrich, Romhild and Winges. It was rare for 
        a village tender not to be bid on by a German resident. Others were employed 
        locally in the brick works, lumber trade, carpentry and blacksmithing. 
        And then there was William Romhild who, when not breaking stone, served 
        as the village constable - an apt employment given his obvious formidable 
        upper-body strength!</p>
      <p>Almost every German immigrant was of the Lutheran faith and as such was 
        connected to St. Paul's Church located at the corner of Wilbrod and King 
        St. (later King Edward Ave.). The original church opened in August of 
        1875 but with the large influx of immigrants in the early 1880's it soon 
        became inadequate. By 1886 the size of the congregation was so large that 
        "three dozen chairs to seat the overflow in the aisles" had to be purchased. 
        In January of 1888 plans for a new church were finalized and in January 
        of the following year, the new stone structure was opened <font size=2>(18)</font>.</p>
      <p>St. Paul's played an integral role in the German community in the late 
        Nineteenth Century. Dependent almost exclusively on new immigrants for 
        the growth of the congregation, the church from its very beginning was 
        actively involved with encouraging emigration from the old country and 
        in many cases provided assistance to those newly arrived.</p>
      <p>Politically the German community played an active role in village life. 
        The surviving village record (1898 to 1907) shows that each year there 
        was at least one German seeking office as a Councilor or School Trustee. 
        Charles Winges served as a Councilor in 1898 and 1900. Other Germans who 
        either sought office of acted as nominators included: H. Herbst, W. Romhild, 
        C. Plett, C. Romhild, F. Winges and A. Tubbe. The detail of their involvement 
        can be found in Chapter Five.</p>
      <p>It is not possible to document every German who lived in Ottawa East 
        up to 1907. The census was taken every ten years and the municipal directories 
        do not list ethnic origin. So therefore, many early residents will not 
        be covered in this brief history. To assist those searching for roots, 
        <u><a href="../../Databases/German_Table_1871_01.htm">a table shown here</a></u> 
        comprising all of the Germans immigrants listed in the 1881, 1891 and

        have been extracted and are <u><a href="../../Databases/ArchDir_77to81.htm">listed

      <p>There were a number of German families who were actively involved in 
        the Village of Ottawa East during its existence. These include, but are 
        not limited to, the Winges, Pranschkes, Noffkes, Messerschmidts, Ullrichs, 
        Lemkes and Romhilds among many others. A brief genealogy of these families
