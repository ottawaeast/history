      <p><b>1. </b>MICHAEL 1 PRANSCHKE. He married HENRIETTE.</p>
      <p>Notes for MICHAEL PRANSCHKE:</p>
      <p>The family of Henriette Pranschke (husband Michael apparently deceased) 
        came to Canada from Woberda (Wobesde?) Prussia on the Ship Hansa that 
        sailed from the Port of Hamburg on the 12th of April 1873. On the ship 
        were Carl, Auguste, their mother listed as a widow (Henriette), brother 
        Franz, his wife Wilhelmina (nee Knopp), their two children Carl and Bertha, 
        sister-in-law Adeline Knopp (who Franz later married) and the widow Knopp. 
        All were listed as being from Woberda (Wobeste?), Prussia. A brother Henry 
        did not emigrate until 1883. He was married and living in Wittbeck previous 
        to his arrival in Ottawa. The ship Hansa brought a large number (32 in 
        all) (some of the first) German settlers to Ottawa. They were all Pomeranians 
        from the Kreis (County) of Stolp, in the Province of Pommern, Prussia.</p>
