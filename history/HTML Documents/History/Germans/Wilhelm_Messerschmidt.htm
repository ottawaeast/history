      <p><b>1. </b>WILHELM 1 MESSERSCHMIDT. He married ANNA E. KOMMEL.</p>
      <p>More About WILHELM MESSERSCHMIDT:</p>
      <p>Fact 1: Parents names given in Beechwood interment record of son John.</p>
      <p>Fact 2: Parents names also given in John’s RGO &amp; St. Paul’s marriage 
        record.</p>
      <p>Notes for ANNA E. KOMMEL:</p>
      <p>In the 1891 census the Messerschmidt, Winges and Romhild familes are 
        listed consecutively in the census. Anne, a widow, is listed in the census 
        after Charles which indicates that she is his mother. John is living in 
        Victoria Ward in this census and is listed as a barber apprentice.</p>
      <p>It appears that Carl age 21 and Anna,(mother or sister?), no age given, 
        arrived on the S.S. Kaffraria from Hamburg with some of the Winges and 
        Romhild family. This ship departed Hamburg on the 15 April 1888. There 
        are no records for Anna Sr. or Anna Jr. beyond the 1901 census and it 
        is assumed they left Ottawa.</p>
