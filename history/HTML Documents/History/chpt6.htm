      the death knell for the Village of Ottawa East. That and the diminishing 
      power of the old guard now subsumed by the demands of increased population 
      and security conscious industries. The physical boundaries offered by a 
      canal and river no longer set the community apart in the minds of a slim 
      majority. Since most people either worked or conducted business in Ottawa 
      on a daily basis, in their minds Ottawa East was de facto a part of Ottawa.

      tax base or other advantages" <b><font size="1">(1)</font></b>. That appears 
      to have been the case in 1906 as Mayor Ellis rekindled the issue of annexation 
      with the city in his plan for a "Greater Ottawa". With this vision, "Ottawa 
      once more cast covetous eyes on the growing suburbs . . . holding out urban 
      services as bait to convince suburban residents to join the city" <b><font size="1">(2)</font></b>.

      the desires of various suburbs.</td>

      <p>Areas such as Hintonburg, Ottawa South and Rideauville were, for the 
        most part, willing to negotiate with the city as demand for certain amenities 
        such as city water, electric power and street car lines increased. But 
        that was not the case in Ottawa East Village as there was definite opposition 
        to joining the city. Beginning in 1903, the village had created its own 
        facilities such as water and sewer systems. And the tax rate was comparable 
        to the city. Many villagers felt that the advantages of annexation were 
        outweighed by the benefits of controlling their own destiny. With the 
        release of Mayor Ellis' vision, the battle for village was joined.</p>
      <b><u> 
      <p>The Vision of a Greater Ottawa</p>
      </u></b> 
      <p>Immediately following his third election victory in a row, Ellis unveiled 
        a new plan for the future of the "Washington of the North". He also wanted 
        a future Ottawa to be regarded also as the "Pittsburgh of the North" <b><font size="1">(3)</font></b>. 
        As reported in the Ottawa Evening Journal on February 6, 1906, he said 
        "The time has come when Ottawa must decide whether it is for all time 
        to be simply the seat of government . . . or whether it will not become 
        an industrial center". Critical to this plan was the acquisition of new 
        territory that would provide "not only sites for factories but also for 
        the necessary homes for the people who would be employed there . . . comfortable 
        houses at moderate rates" <b><font size="1">(4)</font></b>.</p>
      <p>His proposed annexation was to increase the existing 3,365 acres with 
        the addition of 3,704. The plan would add approximately 9,000 to the population 
        of 67,000. This was to be accomplished mostly by taking in the suburbs 
        of Hintonburg, Mechanicsville, Rideauville, Ottawa South and Ottawa East. 
        He noted however, that "I would not propose to annex any of these places 
        without their consent" <b><font size="1">(5)</font></b>. Since Ottawa 
        East and Hintonburg were incorporated their councils had the authority 
        to approve annexation after a vote. Other areas needed to apply to the 
        province for authorization.</p>
      <p>"The most desirable acquisition for Ottawa was certainly Ottawa East" 
        <font size="1"><b>(6)</b></font>. At that time the village was approximately 
        429 acres with a "population of 1800, two schools, a town hall, sidewalks, 
        decent streets and a complete drainage system". The Ottawa East Water 
        Company supplied "all but 300 of the residents" <b><font size="1">(7)</font></b> 
        and the fact that it was privately owned meant a reduced liability for 
        the village. Therefore the assets of the village exceeded the liabilities 
        - a fact that made annexation even more desirable (<a href="chpt5_1907.htm">See 
        Chapter Five - 1907</a>). And it was already an industrial area with a 
        large working class and some industry, including two brick works and various 
        railway shops supporting the Canada Atlantic Railway.</p>
      <p>One of the more desirable aspects was the village's proximity to the 
        transportation corridors of the Rideau Canal and rail lines. The geography 
        that had isolated the village for decades now made it essential to Ellis' 
        plan. He argued that, with the various railroads proposing to run lines 
        in different directions outside of the city limits, it would be in the 
        best interest of the capital to have a "general railway policy" controlled 
        by the municipality. He envisioned a central depot with an entrance along 
        the east side of the canal to be used by passenger traffic only. "Freight 
        should be . . . kept outside the present city limits . . . we should not 
        allow the centre of the city to be turned into a vast freight yard" <b><font size="1">(8)</font></b>. 
        With all the open, cheap land in Ottawa East his problem was solved with 
        annexation. For those who remember when trains ran to the center of Ottawa, 
        they will no doubt agree that this is exactly what happened.</p>
      <p>Ellis' specific comments regarding Ottawa East were directed more towards 
        convincing fellow city politicians as to the desirability of acquiring 
        the village. In referring to correspondence from the village council, 
        he noted that there was an "excess of assets over liabilities of $6,500 
        . . . (and) assessment for 1905 was $500,000" <b><font size="1">(9)</font></b>. 
        The actual amount was under $400.000 <b><font size="1">(10)</font></b>. 
        He indicated that the privately owned water works system had cost $45,000 
        (later figures indicate $50,000) and was so designed that it could be 
        connected to the city's system without difficulty. He went on to point 
        out that, when operated by the city, the water works "would from the first 
        considerably more than pay the necessary yearly outlay upon the capital 
        invested" <b><font size="1">(11)</font></b>.</p>
      <p>Ellis had additional points to buttress his plan for a Greater Ottawa. 
        These included: the provision of "$15 horsepower" from the city-owned 
        electrical system; better fires and police protection; and comparable 
        taxation. These promises however, did little to convince a significant 
        number of villagers.</p>
      <b><u> 
      <p>Village Argument For and Against Annexation</p>
      </u></b> 
      <p>Those opposed to annexation were "firm in their belief that such a course 
        would prove disastrous to the town's interest" <b><font size="1">(12)</font></b>. 
        They pointed to the obvious advantages of an independent community. It 
        was their initiative and investment that had created a valuable suburb 
        with so much potential. The village now owned a creditable sewer system, 
        lighted streets with sidewalks, a private water system and little debt 
        compared to Ottawa. Moreover the future looked bright for the expansion 
        of the village. The Ottawa Journal in 1906 <b><font size="1">(13)</font></b> 
        observed that the village "industrial side is in its infancy while hardly 
        a vacant house can be found". A future expanded village tax base would 
        provide those services, such as police and fire protection, that were 
        lacking at the time.</p>
      <p>Mayor Ellis' announced plan immediately polarized the village as evidenced 
        by the following contrasting views reported in the Ottawa Journal on January 
        1906, page 3:</p>
      
        <p>Walter N. Barry, co-owner of the Harris-Barry Furniture Co. was one 
          of the leading opponents to joining the city. Barry was not only a property 
          owner but also the venerable village clerk from 1897 onwards. He was 
          involved in all aspects of the village operation and his opinion held 
          sway with many villagers. The newspaper characterized him as "a property 
          owner in Ottawa East, with a fine residence on one of the principal 
          streets (Seventh), is emphatic in his position that such a course as 
          proposed would prove the undoing of the village". Barry was then quoted 
          as saying: </p>
      
      <dir> 
        <dir> <i> 
          <p>"Two years ago we might have viewed the proposition with much favor, 
            but since that time many changes have occurred in Ottawa East, which 
            have cost the town considerable, and I think we have already everything 
            in the way of improvements that the city could give us. With such 
            industries that we have - Cain brick and Odell brick companies, along 
            with numerous minor industries supported by the Canada Atlantic shops. 
            I am firm and absolutely decided that annexation is the one thing 
            we do not need."</p>
          </i></dir>
      </dir>
    
        <p>Supporting annexation were people such as John P. Cain, owner of the 
          largest industry in the village - the Cain Brick Company. He was an 
          interloper, a recent entrant into village politics even though he was 
          not even a resident of the village! (The 1907 municipal directory lists 
          his residence as Ottawa.) Ownership of property allowed him to vote 
          or run in the election.</p>
        <p>In 1906, in his appearance on the political scene, he won a seat on 
          council with the largest number of votes. In 1907 he ran for Reeve and 
          was narrowly defeated by R. J. Biggar (181 to 143). Cain's basic political 
          stance was in total support for annexation as he felt it was necessary 
          for the "upbuilding of the village and a promising future". The Ottawa 
          Evening Journal quotes him as saying:</p>
    
      <dir> 
        <dir> "<i>Contrary to the various expressions from leading sources I am 
          thoroughly convinced that to plod along minus a properly fitted municipality 
          viz., the fire equipment, we should some day awake and discover the 
          town in ashes. We cannot afford an up-to-date fire brigade with proper 
          handlings. . . . As for increased taxation, everything being equal, 
          as at present, the annexation would increase property values to the 
          skies and proportionately the percentage increase would diminish instead 
          of increase, as I have heard argued. My platform when running for the 
          council was forcibly for annexation and yet, if the feeling was strong 
          against it, I shall find greater difficulty explaining the voter's attitude 
          for placing me away ahead of the poll". </i></dir>
      </dir>
      
        <p>In reaction to Cain, Joseph H. Patterson, a member of a prominent village 
          family, and an owner of large tracts of land, remarked:</p>
    
      <dir> 
        <dir> <i> 
          <p>"Not on your life . . . most absurd, simply nonsense, and I don't 
            think you can find a dozen people in the village in favour of it. 
            We don't want Ottawa's heavy encumbrances and further, we shall fight 
            to the bitter end against it".</p>
          </i></dir>
      </dir>
      <p>Cain lost the election but in running, he had put the question to the 
        people and therefore polarized the community. He needed only 30 or 40 
        votes to swing his way if council put the question to a vote. We will 
        never know the intricacies of the backroom deliberations in both camps 
        but it is clear that many residents had a vested interest in the outcome. 
        Cain stood to not only gain decent fire protection for his large investment 
        in the brickyard, but also unencumbered access to city contracts as a 
        resident, not someone from the suburbs. People such as Lees, Ballantyne, 
        Bowers and Slattery were large land owners and also major shareholders 
        in the Ottawa East Water Company. As such they stood to reap a windfall 
        if the city expropriated their company at the right price. Perhaps annexation 
        was not so bad after all.</p>
      <p>The council election results of 1907 indicated that Patterson was "whistling 
        past the graveyard". One intangible vote in the final decision involved 
        the newer residents to the village. For the most part these people worked 
        in or at least serviced the city. Joining the city would remove their 
        non-resident status when applying for jobs. City pay for labour was higher 
        that village pay. To these people it was a question of economics and amenities 
        such as an 'electric streetcar crossing a decent bridge'. Their commitment 
        to an historically independent village did not run deep! They saw the 
        future and, unlike those of Patterson's ilk, recognized that "denial was 
        not a river in Egypt"!</p>
      <p>The public debate raged throughout 1906. But although Cain sat on Council 
        there was never any mention of annexation in those minutes. By the summer 
        of 1907 the minutes show that the city's Annexation Committee had entered 
        into a dialogue with the village council. The September 20, 1907 minutes 
        of this committee <b><font size="1">(14)</font></b> detailed a report 
        from the City Engineer on a proposal for sewers in Ottawa South. It concluded 
        that before any work could be done it would be necessary to supply the 
        village first. It read:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>"the entire area of Ottawa South, Rideauville and Ottawa East can be 
          dealt with much more satisfactorily and economically both as regards 
          water supply and sewerage". </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The Committee then authorized the Mayor to communicate with Reeve Biggar 
        "to ascertain if it is advisable to arrange a meeting . . . for the purpose 
        of the annexation of Ottawa East". The joint meeting was held on October 
        18, 1907 and was attended by representatives from the city council and 
        the entire village council. In addition "Messrs. James Ballantyne, B. 
        Slattery, D. Coulter and Jas. Patterson" <b><font size="1">(15) </font></b>also 
        attended.</p>
      <p>The village representatives were presented with terms which were "taken 
        up clause by clause and thoroughly discussed". The basis of the offer 
        was as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <li>the portion of the village east of Hurdman's Bridge would become 
            part of St. George's Ward and all the remainder west placed in the 
            Central Ward;</li>
          <li>the city would assume all debts and obligations and receive all 
            the assets and land of the village;</li>
          <li>the privately-owned water system would be taken over by the city 
            at a valuation to be agreed upon or set by arbitration;</li>
          <li>the lands and residents would be subject to the same municipal obligations 
            and liabilities and be entitled to the same rights and privileges 
            as land and residents in Ottawa;</li>
          <li>lands and buildings would have a fixed assessment as follows:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>all houses, tenements or land not exceeding 10,000 feet would 
              continue to be assessed at the same rate as of the date of annexation 
              for 8 years;</li>
            <li>all vacant land for "whatsoever purpose" used other than for building 
              purposes would have the same 8-year fixed rate except that if land 
              was subdivided or built upon, then the assessment would be fixed 
              at a value similar to property at the time of annexation;</li>
          </ul>
          <li>the city would use its influence with the Dominion Government to 
            secure a bridge over the Rideau Canal "at Mutchmor St. connecting 
            to Clegg or other location to be determined later;</li>
          <li>the village voter's list of 1908 would be used for the city election 
            of 1908</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

          <p>(Extracted from the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board Order of 
            December 10, 1907 found in the City Council Minutes, 1907, pages 743-45. 
            The date for the annexation to be in force was as of December 16, 
            1907.)</p>
        </dir>
      </dir>
      <p>From the minutes of the October 18 meeting of both councils it appears 
        that the only change from the city's original offer was an extension of 
        the "fixed assessment" term from five to eight years. This was done to 
        assuage the concerns of the larger landowners who were also speculators. 
        Annexation would increase property values but not taxes - this meant a 
        larger profit in the end. </p>
      <p>The offer did not however mention any specific dates or actions regarding 
        the improvement of services or facilities in the village. This was a major 
        concern on the part of those opposed to annexation. They felt that the 
        city would not have the money, given the enormous debt it was now assuming 
        with acquisition of several suburbs, to quickly update the community to 
        city standards.</p>
      <p>The issue of the value of the waterworks was essentially deferred. The 
        reported value of the plant ranged from $45,000 to $56,000. The owners, 
        all residents of the village, ultimately did not agree with the final 
        city offer and the matter went to arbitration. City Bylaw 2776 dated June 
        15, 1908 allowed the municipality to officially take over the company 
        and all related property. The Official Arbitrator, appointed under the 
        authority of the Municipal Act later set the compensation value at $69,951.28. 
        He also awarded $46.18 for half of the arbitration fees. The claim was 
        approved with the passing of Bylaw 2824 on December 21, 1908.</p>
      <p>The recommendation of the Annexation Committee was sent to city council 
        and approved. The only additional proviso was that annexation would officially 
        occur on January 1, 1908 and that a vote of the village ratepayers on 
        the question had to occur prior to that date.</p>
      <p>On November 5, 1907, moved by Doran and seconded by Beaton, the council 
        passed Motion #72, which read:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&#9;<i>"that in the opinion of this council,<font color="#990000"> 
          <u><b>it is expedient</b></u></font> that the Village of Ottawa East 
          be annexed to the City of Ottawa on the terms which have been agreed 
          on with the City of Ottawa.&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Carried&quot;</i>

      </center>
      <p>The next motion (#73) set the date for the vote as November 20, 1907. 
        The vote was held as ordered with the village clerk Barry acting as returning 
        officer. The result was 142 in favour and 16 against. The report of the 
        vote submitted at the next meeting concluded with"</p>
      <blockquote> &#9;"<i>The Returning Officer in the presence of the Freeholders 
        then declared that the vote was</i> <i> favourable to annexation"</i> 
        <font size="1"><b>(17)</b></font></blockquote>
      <p><b>It was over!</b> </p>
      <p>The annexation debate that had gripped the village for two years was 
        resolved. Had the offer from the city finally assuaged the monetary concerns 
        of enough villagers for the pro-annexationists to win? It is interesting 
        to compare the council vote of January 1907 with the final vote. Biggar 
        narrowly defeated Cain, a staunch supporter of joining where the total 
        vote was 324 with a ratio of 181 (56%) to 143 (44%). By November the situation 
        had completely reversed. What happened? </p>
      <p>December 13, 1907 was a sad day for many villagers as the council passed 
        its final resolution dissolving itself and the village. There was nothing 
        that could be done. There was no Robert Lees riding to the rescue as he 
        had done in 1888 when the village escaped the city's covetous clutches. 
        People did not take to the streets (amidst the roaming cattle). The trains 
        continued to run. The village just disappeared on paper.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>The actual motion, moved by Doran and seconded by Saunders, read:<br>
          <b>&quot;resolved that we do now pass away. - Goodbye Ottawa East&quot;</b></p>
      </blockquote>
      <center>
        <p>&nbsp;<img src="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_Motion_90.jpg" width="600" height="380"></p>
      </center>
      <p>But, perhaps in a final act of defiance, the last-ever council motion 
        did not receive a number. The Clerk, Walter N. Barry, an ardent opponent 
        to annexation, did not write the appropriate number (#90) in the minutes. 
        For the only time in all of the existing minutes, the clerk omitted the 
        number. Now, almost one hundred years later we can acknowledge his sentiment 
        (We hear you Walt!).</p>
      <p>In retrospect the subsuming of the village by the city was inevitable. 
        History has shown that every suburb (save and except the rich elite of 
        Rockliffe) was eventually taken in by the voracious city. The huge "megalopolis" 
        that was formed was essentially a patchwork of communities all vying for 
        attention. The city did make some improvements to Ottawa East. Pretoria 
        Bridge was built replacing the inadequate structure that connected Main 
        to Argyle St. across the canal. On January 18, 1909 Bylaw 2828 authorized 
        the laying of 8-inch water pipe from Mutchmor to Clegg; and 12-inch pipe 
        from Robert St. to Main. This finally connected the village to city water. 
        But these, as well as other changes are best described in the next history 
        of Ottawa East that hopefully will be written sometime in the future.</p>
