        the Ottawa Valley is the home of a nation's capital and an active participant 
        in the high-tech sector of the twenty-first century. In the nineteenth 
        century, it was at the heart of the Canadian logging industry. Before 
        that, the Ottawa River was a major travel route for explorers and fur 
        traders. However, prior to the arrival of Europeans, the region had witnessed 
        thousands of years of Native history.<br>
        <br>
        Kichi Sibi, which means great river in the Algonquin language, provides 
        an overview of<img src="../../Graphics/zone1imgvd-2.jpg" width="200" height="151" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="3"> 
        the ancient history of the Ottawa Valley using artifacts found in the 
        region. Picnickers, hikers, farmers and avocational archaeologists found 
        these objects over the past 150 years and donated them to museums. Their 
        generosity, hard work and interest in preserving the past have given us 
        a greater awareness of the Valley's ancient history. </p>
      <p>The artifacts found throughout the Ottawa Valley allow archaeologists 
        to piece together the region's ancient history. They tell us, for example, 
        that Native peoples lived here for about 8,000 years before the arrival 
        of Europeans.</p>
      <p>Fifteen thousand years ago, the continental glacier, which extended over 
        all of eastern Canada, began to melt, leaving behind vast bodies of water.</p>
      <p><b>An Emerging Landscape - the Champlain Sea</b> </p>
      <p><img src="../../Graphics/mersm.jpg" width="144" height="122" align="left" vspace="3" hspace="3">Some 
        12,000 to 13,000 years ago, the Ottawa Valley was covered by an inland 
        sea called the Champlain Sea. It was about 150 metres higher than the 
        current river levels in Ottawa-Hull. The region&#146;s environment was 
        barren, cold and inhospitable. It is not known if people lived here at 
        the time.</p>
      <p><b>Glimpses of the Sea</b><br>
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Champlain Sea, which covered the Ottawa Valley until about 10,000 
        years ago, supported a rich variety of marine life, including whales, 
        seals and several species of saltwater fish. Small herds of caribou and 
        other Arctic animals probably lived in the area around the sea, but no 
        evidence has been found of a human presence in the region. <br>
      </p>
      <p><b>The Earliest Evidence - The Palaeo-Indian Period (-8500) </b><br>
      </p>
      <p>The earliest evidence of a human presence in the Ottawa Valley dates 
        from approximately 8,500 years ago. Environmental conditions had improved 
        considerably by that time, as the Champlain Sea disappeared, and new plants 
        and animals emerged. </p>
      <p>The people who lived during the Palaeo-Indian Period made distinctive 
        long and slender stone lance or javelin points. <br>
      </p>
      <b>Early Hunting Weapons </b> 
      <p>These elongated stone lance or javelin points were probably used to kill 
        large animals such as caribou. They were carefully chipped to remove thin, 
        parallel flakes from roughly shaped pieces of stone. Their shape and the 
        way they were made indicate that they date from the Late Palaeo-Indian 
        Period (about 8,000 to 8,500 years ago). </p>
      <p>Two of the examples shown here were found on an island in the St. Lawrence 
        River near Cornwall, rather than in the Ottawa Valley. The point with 
        the small notches may be the only Ottawa Valley artifact from this early 
        time period.</p>

        ago. </p>
      <p>The people who lived in the region during that period made noticeable

      <p>The ancient history of the Ottawa Valley ends with the arrival of Europeans, 
        who recorded the way of life of the local Native people. In 1613, when 
        Champlain first travelled on the Ottawa River, he met Algonquin bands 
        and recorded their names: Quenongebin, O&uuml;escariny, Kinouchepirini, 
        Kichesipirini, Otaguottouemin, Matou-o&uuml;escariny and Charioquet. However, 
        archaeologists are not sure if those people left behind the artifacts 
        found at late Woodland Period sites. More research is required.<br>
