        a clerk living on Second St. Council included John Bremner, a stone cutter 
        on Fourth<sup></sup> St.; Charles Winges, a millwright on Main St.; James 
        R. Logan, a foreman on Canal Rd.; and William C. Ogilvie, a carpenter 
        on Second<sup></sup> St.. The clerk was William Barry, who served in that 
        position until the Village ended in 1907.</p>

      <p><u><b>Overview of the Year</b></u>:</p>
      <p>The major item for the year was the creation of a waterworks that was 
        never built. Council gave the monopoly to supply the village to an Edward 
        Joseph Rainbosh of the Ottawa Suburban Waterworks Ltd. However there is 
        no record of anything being built by this company. Apart from that, it 
        appeared to be a normal council year with the usual duties when compared 
        to the following years where more information is available.</p>

      <p><u><b>Appointments</b></u><u>:</u></p>
      <p>Most of the appointments were made in January and therefore lost. (<a href="chpt5_miss.htm">See 
        Missing Records</a>) We do know that the constable was Walter F. Bompas, 
        a carpenter living at 76 Canal Road. In November, Reeve Webster retired 
        for some reason and W. C. Ogilvie acted in his stead for the remainder 
        of the term. Bylaw #56 appointed Herman Jordan, a labourer living at 28 
        Fourth<sup></sup> St., as the pound keeper since Mr. Maher on Fifth<sup></sup> 
        St. had resigned. There was never any description in any of the records 
        regarding the duties of the pound keeper but it can be assumed that it 
        was a holding area for dogs, wandering cows and any other beast not allowed 
        at large.</p>
      <b></b> 
      <p><u><b>Communications</b></u><u>:</u></p>
      <p>At the beginning of each meeting, council would review correspondence 
        received and direct the clerk to respond where required. Some examples 
        include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use of the town hall was granted to: the Women&#146;s Auxiliary of 
          Trinity Church for a bazaar; James Sur_t? for a gospel meeting; and 
          the Ottawa East Debating Society;</li>
        <li>J. Bower requested that sidewalks be built on Canal St.;</li>
        <li>A letter was sent to the county representative (J. Ballantyne?) regarding 
          irregularities at the County Crown Attorney&#146;s office. A reply was 
          received from Ballantyne;</li>
        <li>J. R. Booth (a prominent lumber baron) requested a crossing on Canal 
          Rd.;</li>
        <li>Martin O&#146;Gara (a fiery Ottawa magistrate) wrote to council claiming 
          damages for a Sister Demers as her cow had been killed and she felt 
          the village was responsible;</li>
        <li>The railway was admonished not to leave cars on the tracks obstructing 
          the roadway (Main St.?) and to keep the area lighted;</li>
        <li>Residents requested that the railway be notified to stop excessive 
          train whistling;</li>
        <li>Permission was requested from the Ottawa and New York Railway for 
          a crossing of Ann St.</li>
      </ul>
      <b></b> 
      <p><u><b>Pubic Works</b></u>:</p>
      <p>As in later years, the council of 1898 concerned itself with new roads, 
        railway crossings, sidewalks and drainage. While the infrastructure of 
        old Archville comprised the main part of the village with streets such 
        as Drummond, Bronson and Clegg in the south, most were without sidewalks 
        or permanent drainage. And it appears that at this point in the history 
        of the village there was no fire department, street lighting, waterworks 
        or permanent sewers.</p>
      <p>Some of the public works items listed in the minutes included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tender from Dougald Fisher, a labourer on the east side of McGillivray 
          St. was accepted to lay sidewalk at 20 cents/panel. A panel consisted 
          of two cedar poles set in crushed stone with 2 inch cedar planks, 3 
          feet long and nailed across the poles. He installed 109 lengths. He 
          also received $9.00 for grading Drummond and Bronson St.;</li>
        <li>Residents on Herridge and Clegg requested drainage as soon as possible;</li>
        <li>Ballantyne requested a sidewalk on 7<sup>th</sup> St.;</li>
        <li>Wages paid by the village for labour included $1.25/day for one man 
          and $2.00/day if he used a horse. Removing the carcass of a dead animal 
          paid $1.00;</li>
      </ul>
      <b></b> 
      <p><u><b>Council Motions, Policies and Bylaws</b></u>:</p>
      <p>Everything from expenditures to the laying out of streets was dealt with 
        by motions and bylaws. For the most part council passed motions to set 
        policy. Some examples included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Warnings of prosecution were to be sent to &quot;those letting cattle 
          and horses at large&quot;;</li>
        <li>Bylaw #61 was passed establishing new roadways east of Hurdman Rd. 
          Specifically the area in question was the north half of Lot G in Concession 
          D. One back lane was to be 10 feet wide while the street was 50 feet 
          wide and to be named Robinson Avenue. The land was owned by T. W. McKermont? 
          and R. P. Robinson, a contractor who lived at 218 Canal Rd.;</li>
        <li>Bylaws #55 and #57 were passed giving authority to build a water system 
          and expropriate land but as noted above, nothing ever came of this action.</li>
        <li>The property mill rates were as follows:</li>
      </ul>
