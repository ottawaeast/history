      <p>Much has been written about the &quot;Rideau Waterway&quot;, particularly 
        by Robert Leggett. Most people are familiar with the wonderful stories 
        that illuminate the system of rivers and locks that run from Ottawa via 
        the Big Rideau to the Cataraqui. Neglected however, is the stretch from 
        Montreal to Ottawa. Unlike the Rideau section, this part of the system 
        receives little recognition by most people.</p>
      <p>The Grenville and Carillon locks were constructed on the Ottawa River 
        to facilitate the easy movement of vessels to and from Montreal. Begun 
        in 1819,( before By began in 1826), these locks were as equally important 
        and difficult to build as the Rideau Locks. The work was completed in 
        1834.</p>
      <p>Lieutenant Colonel By was involved in the construction here in that he 
        personally supported the men building these locks without which his locks 
        were irrelevant. In addition to his personal encouragement, he joined 
        forces with the Royal Staff Corp in battling inept contractors and twisted 
        bureaucrats.</p>

      <p>Even further downstream there are critical elements to the entire system, 
        at Montreal. Remember that the objective was to sail from England and, 
        with a minimum of transhipment, directly to Kingston via Ottawa. The first 
        real obstacle was found at Ste. Anne de Bellevue. The Ste. Ann Rapids 
        were first skirted in 1816 with a small wooden lock and later replaced 
        by masonry in 1843.</p>
      <p>Upstream of this, the river becomes the Lake of Two Mountains. This is 
        not a lake but rather a 12-mile stretch of river of incredibly flat landscape 
        with few distinguishing features. Eventually, 27 miles from Ste. Anne, 
        the Carillon Rapids are encountered. Work on circumventing this impediment 
        began in 1829. Three locks were built lifting vessels fourteen feet. The 
        vessels were small ocean-going craft and those barge-like vessels that 
        sailed Lake Ontario. There was another short canal at Chute &agrave; Blondeau.</p>
      <p>A few miles upstream are the Long Sault Rapids. Preliminary research 
        on the navigation impediment began as early as 1815. The massive undertaking 
        involved construction of a 6-mile canal with 7 locks with a lift of 43 
        feet. Compare that to the 8 locks and 80 feet of lift below Parliament 
        Hill.</p>
      <p>After these locks there was 56 miles of unimpeded waterway to Ottawa. 
      </p>
      <p>The importance of this waterway system to the tiny village of Ottawa 
        East cannot be understated. Yes, the canal did form the western boundary 
        of the community and essentially isolate (and therefore preserve) a distinct 
        group. But it also provided a major economic bonus for the businesses 
        located to the east of Ottawa. From coal to bricks, the economy of Ottawa 
        East was dependent on cheap transportation.</p>
      <p>The O'Dell brickyard excavated clay at the end of Springhurst Ave., fired 
        the kilns with coal delivered via the canal which later transported the 
        finished product to local markets and beyond. The Graham and Cain brickyards 
        did the same. The Silicate Brick Company had a large jetty on the canal 
        at Graham Avenue where sand was delivered from the Uplands sandpits. The 
        Stewarton Lumber Company had a ready supply of finished lumber stacked 
        along the banks of the canal at Echo and Main. George Barrett operated 
        the company out of his general store just a few blocks south on Main St., 
        at Hawthorne.<br>
        <br>
        And there were no bridges in the area that could handle the heavy wood 
        and brick loads. In essence, the canal not only helped to create Ottawa 
        East as a distinct entity, but it subsequently helped it flourish. One 
        can only imagine the potential that has been lost with the creation of 
        a scenic driveway!<br>
