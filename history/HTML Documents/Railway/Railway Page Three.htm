    <td colspan="2">In 1912, The Canadian Northern Railway, the new transcontinental 
      system being constructed by William Mackenzie and Donald Mann arrived in 
      Ottawa. Their main servicing facility was west of Prince of Wales Drive 
      where Hunt Club Road now passes over the VIA Rail line to Smiths Falls. 
      However, they constructed a small Ottawa passenger station at Mann Avenue 
      and needed some engine facility close at hand to services their passenger 
      locomotives. So they constructed a small roundhouse near the station. The 
      exact location is unknown but would have been against the hill north of 
      Lees Avenue. This facility was short-lived being closed with the formation 
      of Canadian National Railways which absorbed both the Canadian Northern 
      and later the Grand Trunk. CN merged all servicing at the former Mann Avenue 
      Grand Trunk facilities previously mentioned.</td>

      the early 1950s when it was replaced by a concrete-block one-stall building.

      in the Ottawa East area. However, life for the railway employees of the 
      community was not easy. The jobs were much more hazardous than today. The 
      hours were long and crews for trains could be called to work at any time, 
      day or night and on weekends (although most people worked a six-day week, 
      not just railway workers). Often train crews might be away from their families 
      for several days. For shop employees, the work was often dirty and, by today's 
      standards, even unhealthy, although it was like that in many industries, 
      not just the railways.</td>

    <td colspan="2">Very little changed over the years for railway operations 
      in the Ottawa East area. Locomotives became larger so fewer were needed. 
      But the labour-intensive industry still needed a lot of employees. Finally, 
      in the late 1950s, the railways in Canada began to convert to diesel locomotives 
      which required much less maintenance and attention. By the end of 1959, 
      Canadian National had discontinued steam operations and many railway workers 
      lost their jobs. In Ottawa East, the old Mann Avenue roundhouse closed in 
      1964 leaving only the remnants of the freight yard. As businesses moved 
      out of the area, the need for the yards diminished further until only trackage 
      was required to access the old Union Station (the present government conference 
      centre on Rideau Street) and provide a wye for turning the passenger trains. 
      The yard was removed in preparation for the building of the Queensway. When 
      the Union Station was closed in 1966, the last of the trackage in the Ottawa 
      East area was removed ending a railway connection with the community spanning 
      84 years.</td>
