    <td colspan="2">But the railway also had some negative effects on the community. 
      There was the noise, the smoke and the dangers of having trains moving and 
      shunting in the community. On several occasions, the Ottawa East Village 
      council had to address a request by the CAR for changes to street crossings 
      and other issues. When the tracks were built, it was found they were too 
      close to the village school on what is now Concord St North and complaints 
      were made to the company by the village council. This may have contributed 
      to the decision to build a new school further away from the right-of-way. 
      That new school is still there today.</td>

    <td colspan="2">By 1896, Booth was extending his railway system west with 
      the construction of the Ottawa, Arnprior and Prairie Sound Railway (OA&amp;PS) 
      to Parry Sound. This meant more business and consequently more equipment 
      and labourers. His shop facilities at Elgin Street were probably not large 
      enough and there wasn't room to expand, so the Canada Atlantic Railway looked 
      for a new location. The company found it at Mann Avenue with the construction 
      of the tracks along the canal to the company's new Central Station at Rideau 
      Street, a converted warehouse building. The company needed a wye for turning 
      trains so purchased property south of Nicholas street and filled it in (about 
      where the Nicholas street Queensway on-ramp is located). In the middle of 
      the wye, the company built its new roundhouse containing 22 locomotive stalls 
      and 6 storage tracks for its cabooses and included a shop for repairs. 
      <p>This expansion would no doubt have created further growth in the area 
        as new staff would be required and many of the workers would have found 
        or built homes in Ottawa East north of the tracks. The Grand Trunk Railway 
        took over the Canada Atlantic in 1905 but kept the facilities which survived 
        until the early 1960s when they were demolished in preparation for construction 
        of the Nicholas Street/Queensway interchange.</p>

      <p>With railway expansion came increased business with companies opening 
        along the tracks. Industries opened up west of the canal. As mentioned 
        before, the Ottawa Gas Works opened on Lees Avenue. The company even had 
        its own small industrial locomotives used to move cars of coal around 
        its property. J &amp; T Ballantyne Fuels used the railway to bring in 
        coal and even constructed a large coal shed in about 1915 adjacent to 
        Echo Drive.</p>
      <p>The Canada Atlantic Railway (later the Grand Trunk and finally Canadian 
        National Railways) was not the only railway to have a roundhouse in the 
        area. There is newspaper evidence that Canadian Pacific Railway constructed 
        a small roundhouse in the vicinity of the former Algonquin College building 
        on Lees Avenue. This was done to serve the railway's new line (1896) from 
        Montreal via Vankleek Hill. This small stall facility would have provided 
        even more employment for the Ottawa East area. However, the roundhouse 
        did not last long as CP centralized its engine facilities at its larger 
        Ottawa West location (at Bayview Road and Scott Street) likely by the 
        1920s.</p>
