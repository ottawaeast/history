      <p>Working with air photos can reveal much about any community. There are 
        a few simple guidelines to follow when you first start your analysis. 
        The suggestions below will aid you in this endeavour.</p>
      <p><b>1- Use Imaging Software:</b> First and foremost, consider loading 
        the air photos in your own image software rather than the browser software 
        you are using at this moment. This will allow for much more flexibility 
        in photo analysis in terms of zooming and scrolling. Follow this path 
        to find the air photos:</p>
      <p><br>
        (Your CD Drive letter) : History of Ottawa East\HTML Documents\Image Library\Air 
        Photos</p>
      <p>You can now toggle back and forth between the browser and the image software. 
      </p>
      <p><b>2- Orient the photograph:</b><br>
        Almost all of the aerial photos on this disk have been rotated so that 
        north is towards the top of the image. Therefore, the Rideau Canal will 
        be on the left and the Rideau River on the right. Find key points such 
        as the Gas Plant on Lees Ave., Pretoria Bridge, the &quot;Deep Cut&quot; 
        (where the canal makes a sharp left turn to travel west), the Exhibition 
        Grounds (on the west bank of the canal) and the Scholasticate (on the 
        west shore of the river). With these points established, it should be 
        relatively easy to identify Main St. that runs from the northwest to the 
        south east from the canal to the river.</p>
      <p>If you are not familiar with Ottawa East then <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Ottawa%20East%20Streets%20Modern.jpg">go 
        here for a modern map of the area</a>. Either print this map or load it 
        in a second browser window. Correlate (compare) the map to the photograph 
        to establish the correct orientation of the landscape.</p>
      <p><b>3- Find what is not there:</b><br>
        Equally as important as what is in the photo, is what is missing. The 
        photos begin in 1922 and end around 1960. Almost all of the photos will 
        have the year in the title. For example, A26_36_1928 is a photo taken 
        in 1928. By loading photos by date you will see the evolution of the landscape. 
      </p>
      <p>Alternately you can go to a hotlinked map <a href="Air_Photo_Study_Page_One.htm#Interactive">found 
        here</a>. Use the green boxes to move through a sequence of photos from 
        1922, 1928, 1931, 1938 and 1956.</p>
      <p><b>4- Identify the time of year:</b><br>
        Photos taken in the early Spring will have pockets of snow and the river 
        will be swollen with the ice melt. Photos taken in the late Fall will 
        show groomed fields and a smaller river. Snow can be confusing when trying 
        to identify an area.</p>
      <p><b>5- Street and Building Analysis</b>:<br>
        Use the 1902 and 1956 Fire Insurance Maps as they provide excellent detail 
        of the buildings on each street. If you want to see the evolution of your 
        street, start with the 1902 Fire Insurance Map, track the street with 
        the photos and see what has been built by 1956</p>
      <p><b>6- Crop the photograph:</b><br>
        Using your own imaging software, identify the area that you are interested 
        in and then &quot;crop&quot; the photo with the tool available on all 
        good software. Save the cropped image to a temporary file where you can 
        manipulate the image attributes. For example, a smaller image will load 
        faster and you can play with software functions such as sharpening, despeckling, 
        contrast and brightness. One trick is to invert the cropped image (black 
        become whites, whites become blacks). This will highlight aspects such 
        as foliage and streams. Lots of fun - give it a try!<br>
