      <p>Every now and then, when doing research such as this, one encounters 
        a treasure that in the end makes the effort worthwhile. The photograph 
        below is an example. </p>
      <p>Taken in 1922, from a &quot;Flying Boat&quot; (an amphibious aircraft), 
        it is one of the earliest air photographs taken of the Ottawa area. From 
        my research it appears that it is the earliest one ever in terms of Ottawa 
        East. It must be remembered that this was a time of infancy not only for 
        human flight but also aerial photography. The way the story goes (an unsubstantiated 
        story at present), the Canadian Air Force was attempting to demonstrate 
        the usefulness of aircraft to the military and therefore the government. 
        During this time several flight lines were made over the Ottawa area and 
        up the Gatineau River, sequentially photographing the landscape from the 
        air. This photograph is supposedly a result of this activity.</p>
      <p>In researching the history of Ottawa East as seen through the earliest 
        air photographs I spent many days in the National Air Photograph Library 
        on Booth St., here in Ottawa. After hours of hauling large metal boxes 
        of glossy photos to the desk with the stereoscopic viewer I happened to 
        ask one of the library workers if perchance, there were other very old 
        photos stored elsewhere. She said that it was unlikely, so I moved on 
        to other things. About an hour later she returned and mentioned that she 
        did remember some old scrapbooks piled in the bottom of a locker in an 
        area not open to the public. Off we went and sure enough, at the bottom 
        of a very dusty gray metal locker, were some very old scrapbooks. If you 
        understand the concept of &quot;serendipity&quot; then you will appreciate 
        what happened next. Had I not asked the question, the photograph would 
        have been missed.</p>
      <p>The book contained about 30 of the most amazing oblique photographs I 
        have ever encountered. When I turned to #20 I think my heart skipped a 
        beat. There before my weary eyes was 1922 Ottawa East (and more), in excellent 
        resolution. The photo was part of the &quot;H&quot; series, one of the 
        oldest at the library. Subsequent research showed that the original nitrate 
        negatives had been destroyed and as yet, no record has been found of the 
        actual flight line or date. </p>
      <p>The number on the photo is HA5 - 20 - 1922 and <u>this is incorrect</u>. 
        That flight line was taken in 1921 and does not cover the Ottawa Area. 
      </p>
      <p>The correct number is HA - 20 - 1922. </p>
      <p>Given that the original negatives had been destroyed (nitrate film has 
        a tendency to catch fire), I had the photograph scanned at the highest 
        resolution available. The image, delivered on CD-ROM, was over 6,000 pixels 
        wide, 800 dpi and over 75 megabytes. When loaded in powerful imaging software 
        I could blow it up to over 400% without losing much of the quality. And 
        what is revealed is a time capsule - fixing a point in the history of 
        the community. You can see a steam engine chugging along the tracks, the 
        infamous incinerator at the end of Lees Ave., the lonely 'Stone Gates&quot; 
        at the entrance to Brantwood Place with only a couple of houses - hell 
        you can even see a dog barking on Clegg Street!</p>
      <p>At this point many of you are probably wondering if this writer &quot;has 
        a life&quot;. I can only reply in comparison, that there are those, for 
        example, who consider chasing a little white ball around manicured lawns 
        in pseudo forests to be worthwhile endeavour. Happiness to this writer 
        is finding treasures that may be lost to time and writing self-indulgent 
        comments about the activity. But hey - the CD is free!</p>
      <p>And now, on to the picture. The very best way of viewing this remarkable 
        photograph is to load it into your imaging software. This will allow you 
        to manipulate the resolution, contrast and other attributes. You will 
        find the image (OTT22_3000pix.jpg) at 3,000 pixels in width and about 
        5.3 megabytes located at the end of this path:<br>
        <br>
        &gt; &gt; &gt; (Your CD Drive Letter)<b>:</b>\History of Ottawa East\HTML 
        Documents\Image Library\Airphotos\ OTT22_3000pix.jpg</p>
      <p>You can also find a 7.3 megabyte version <a href="../../Image%20Library/Airphotos/H_5_1922_clr_oe.jpg">here</a>.</p>
      <p>The version shown just below is 1,000 pixels wide. Click anywhere on 
        the photo and your browser will bring up the 3,000 pixel wide version. 
        In some cases, such as Netscape 4.7 (time to upgrade!) this may start 
        up your imaging software by default. And depending on your screen resolution 
        and monitor, you may have to scroll a wee bit.</p>
      <p>North points to the upper right hand corner of the photo. The Exhibition 
        Grounds are in the bottom left-center. Find the &quot;Deep Cut&quot; (where 
        the Canal turns sharp left), Pretoria Bridge and the Scholasticate. Main 
        Street is between these points running northwest to southeast.</p>
      <p>Whatever happens, spend some time with this treasure. It is a fascinating 
        view of the early community.<br>
