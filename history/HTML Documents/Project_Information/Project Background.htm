    <td>This project came about as the result of a search for an historical context. 
      For the past two decades I have been involved in the genealogical search 
      for my family roots. In the course of this work I have explored much of 
      the United Kingdom's history as far back as the Seventeenth Century using 
      historical records. I am always amazed at how much information is available 
      about such topics as tiny obscure villages in the Scottish Highlands. This 
      type of information has significantly added to the understanding of my Scottish, 
      English and Irish roots. 
      <p>Upon retiring from teaching in late 2001, with more time I decided to 
        expand my research to include Canadian history. This was intended to provide 
        the setting that my ancestors encountered when they immigrated to Canada. 
        Since all of the four branches of my family eventually settled in the 
        Ottawa area, in particular Ottawa East, I concluded that it would be relatively 
        easy to research this history. But that was not to be the case.</p>
      <p>I quickly learned that apart from a few snippets in general history books, 
        there were no detailed record of the history of Ottawa East in print. 
        Yes, there were census records, municipal directories and a box in the 
        city archives with some odds and ends, but there was no narrative that 
        chronicled the evolution of the community. It was almost as if Ottawa 
        East never existed. Confronted with this situation I made the somewhat 
        presumptuous decision that I would write the history.</p>
      <p>My initial thought was to produce a small booklet detailing some key 
        people and events; include some historical pictures; and a map. This I 
        believed would take just a few months and be self-published via my trusty 
        computer. With the initial research however, I began to encounter a wealth 
        of fascinating material that illuminated a truly interesting story.</p>
      <p>The first major discovery was the photographic record that had been left 
        by the incomparable James Ballantyne, one of the fathers of Ottawa East 
        and a true &quot;Renaissance man&quot;. Amongst the many gifts left to 
        the community by this man were over 800 photographs that detailed the 
        life of the Village of Ottawa East, all preserved on glass negatives stored 
        in the National Archives. Researching this collection was thrilling but 
        it raised the question of how to make the images available to everyone.</p>
      <p>It was at this point that I decided to drop the idea of using paper as 
        the medium and switch to the power and storage capability of the CD-ROM. 
        The rationale was that since almost everyone today has access to a computer, 
        with the use of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) not only could everything 
        be included but it would also be searchable. Therefore this format provided 
        limitless possibilities in terms of genealogical databases, image libraries 
        and the permanent storage of unique items that would have been lost to 
        time. </p>
      <p>Realizing that the project now required some financial support, I approached 
        the Old Ottawa East Community Association (OOECA) for assistance. From 
        the very first phone call the idea of writing a local history was met 
        with enthusiasm and unqualified support. A successful grant application 
        was made by the association to the City of Ottawa Heritage Funding Program 
        in the fall of 2002. While the project received only a portion of the 
        requested support, the money was sufficient to pay for some of the research 
        costs and production of 200 copies of the CD.</p>
      <p>By the winter of 2003 the research was in high gear. Each week brought 
        a new source of information and material began to grow as if it were an 
        inverse pyramid. Along the way I encountered many individuals who enthusiastically 
        supported the project. It is not possible in this short space to mention 
        all of them but there is more information in the Acknowledgements Section. 
        People such as Sue Hill, Fathers Dubois and Pigeon of the Oblate Order, 
        Serge Barbe of the city archives, Andrew Roger of the National Archives, 
        Bruce Ballantyne and many, many more all gave of their resources and encouragement. 
        It was only through the kindness of people such as these that the project 
        was successful.</p>
      <p>Of signal importance was the chance encounter with Gandalf, the technical 
        wizard. In early 2003 I attended a lecture given by David Walker at the 
        British Isles Family History Society of Greater Ottawa. The topic focused 
        on the use of computers in historical and genealogical research. I approached 
        David with some of the project's technical difficulties and he agreed 
        to help. The rest is history and the reason that you are now reading this 
        text is due in large part to his expertise as the Technical Director of 
        the project.</p>
      <p>By the winter of 2004 I decided that the never-ending story had to end 
        and I selected the arbitrary date of May 15 as &quot;CD-ROM Launch Day&quot;. 
        The OOECA formed a committee and an event was planned. Hopefully all went 
        well!</p>
      <p>It is often said in genealogical circles that every family has a &quot;keeper 
        of the records&quot;. To that end it has been a privilege to give back 
        to a community that provided so many wonderful experiences in my youth. 
        When asked about my roots I always say, with a great sense of pride, that 
        &quot;I grew up in Ottawa East&quot;.<br>
