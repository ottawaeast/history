    <td>Hey! Congratulations, you have found the &quot;secret spot&quot;. Thanks 
      for the effort. 
      <p>And what did you win? Well . . . actually nothing . . . except a profound 
        sense of accomplishment and a wee story that few people will read.</p>
      <p>A somewhat tired writer who has spent the past two years assembling the 
        history of a community that he learned to love as a child is writing this 
        in April of 2004. In the course of this work I have constantly asked myself 
        what could be written that would personalize my feelings about Ottawa 
        East. In the end I decided to write about my secret spot - the place where 
        I had the most fun as a child.</p>
      <p>As a kid in the 1950's I learned to create my own entertainment. Coming 
        from a family that had little in the way of financial resources it was 
        necessary to make use of what was available. And that was Ottawa East. 
        There was a river, a canal, an abandoned gas works, a huge railway yard, 
        a stable for Walker's Bread horses, a slaughterhouse, a forest and some 
        good buddies. The possibilities were endless.</p>

    <td>
      <p>Skating on the canal; feeding horses or watching the blacksmith; stealing 
        wood from the rail yard for rafts; playing football at St. Pat's; watching 
        pigs be decapitated at the slaughterhouse; climbing the gas tank; or running 
        along the tops of slow moving freight cars were just some of the things 
        that made life interesting. Compared to today's penchant for child safety, 
        it was insane - but damn it was fun!</p>
      <p>Most of all it was the river that provided an endless amount of enjoyment. 
        Yes, there was Brantwood Beach where I learned to swim but my favourite 
        spot was further downstream, just about the end of Springhurst Avenue. 
        In those days the forest surrounding this spot was much denser and this 
        separated the location from nearby houses and prying eyes. Many a summer's 
        day was spent diving off the rocks, catching frogs, firing BB guns, building 
        rafts and even fishing. The fact that the river was polluted never occurred 
        to us, it was just a fun place to be with no rules.</p>
      <p>And now for some serendipity.</p>
      <p>In the course of researching this project I have looked at thousands 
        of pictures, documents, maps and other things. Of all these treasures, 
        my favourite is this picture. To me this smiling little girl, sitting 
        on a rail fence in the late summer sun, is the quintessential portrait 
        of early Ottawa East. It was a time of the simple enjoyment of life and 
        she exudes that happiness.</p>

    <td>By happenstance I managed to conclusively identify the location of this 
      photograph. It was one of a series of photographs taken by James Ballantyne 
      on one of his excursions. Compared to the other photographs taken on that 
      day, it is clear that the location is at the end of the Lees farm, beside 
      the Rideau River, almost exactly where present-day Springhurst Avenue concludes. 
      My favourite secret spot! 
      <p>So I ask the question. Why is it that my most favourite photograph, taken 
        over a century ago, turns out to be exactly where my favourite spot was 
        located? Was it coincidence? Or was it meant to be?</p>
      <p>Please take a moment and answer the question. Send me an email at:</p>

      <p>with the subject heading &quot;Secret Spot&quot;. I would very much appreciate 
        your thoughts. Of course if you are reading this in some archive, say 
        a hundred years from now, then you may experience some difficulty reaching 
        me electronically. By the time I probably will have departed for the &quot;Far 
        Isles of Langerhan&quot;. But I do hope you enjoyed this wee story and 
        the history found on this CD. I was intended as a gift.</p>
