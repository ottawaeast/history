    <td>If there is one special person in the history of Ottawa East, then it 
      must be James Ballantyne - a true &quot;Renaissance man&quot;. Of slight 
      stature, quiet in disposition and brilliant of mind, James was the man who 
      led Ottawa East from a motley collection of homes and businesses to a thriving 
      successful village. His story is fascinating. 
      <p>Born in Newcastleton, Scotland on May 9, 1835, he immigrated to Canada 
        with his <a href="../Image%20Library/People/CA4_3_Ballantyne_James_1835_1925.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/People/sm/CA4_3_Ballantyne_James_1835_1925%20sm.jpg" width="126" height="157" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="3" border="0" alt="James Ballantyne"></a>family 
        at the age of five. First settling in Smith Falls, he later moved to Ottawa 
        in 1863 to establish a cooperage (barrel-making) business with his brother 
        Thomas. They later moved to Ottawa East in the 1870's to start a fuel 
        supply business on Echo Drive. From that point until his death in 1926 
        he became an integral part of the community. There is much more to the 
        story of the Ballantyne family, written by his grand nephew Bruce Ballantyne 
        located<a href="../Mainstreeter/Ballantynes%20in%20Ottawa%20East.htm">

    <td colspan="2">During his time in the community, he established the first 
      schools; became the first village reeve (later the treasurer); was elected

      town hall; founded the Ottawa Camera Club; helped establish the Ottawa Literary 
      and Scientific Society (later the Ottawa Field Naturalists Club) and much, 
      much more. 
      <p>Above all else he left he left an enduring legacy. In 1892 he donated 
        the oldest artifact ever found in Ottawa East to the Geological Survey 
        of Canada (more on that story<a href="../History/Prehistoric%20Adze%20-%20Ballantyne.htm"> 
        here</a>). When his daughter Mae died (see obituary <a href="Ballantyne%20Obituaries.htm#Isa">here</a>) 
        just a few years after his passing, the family had his home demolished 
        at 54 Main St. and the land donated to the community. We now know it as 
        Ballantyne Park. But above all else he left a special visual gift for 
        the future residents of the community.<br>

    <td colspan="2">As a photographer James was a visionary. He knew that the 
      most important pictures were not of politicians or marble buildings, but 
      rather of people, landscapes and everyday activities. From about 1890, usually 
      with the help of his daughter Mae, he regularly set out with his large box 
      camera and tripod to record the daily life of the village. He captured moments 
      of ordinary life that most considered to be of no importance. These pictures 
      have now become treasures. Mrs. Harvey's cows, Purdy and the boys leaning 
      against his fence, road construction on Main St., haying on Lees' farm, 
      playing cards at Wildwood and boating on the canal - all glimpses of a life 
      long ago. 
      <p>Thanks to the care of his descendents the &quot;James Ballantyne Photographic 
        Collection&quot; was preserved and donated to the National Archives of 
        Canada in 1981. Partly as a result of this history project the archives 
        have placed the entire collection online for all to see.</p>
      <p>James Ballantyne left a 'gift of time' to the people of Ottawa East. 
        As such, it is the single most-important contribution to this project. 
        For that we thank him and honour his memory.<br>
