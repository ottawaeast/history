        the Bering Sea <br>
        arbitration with the United States in 1893-4, following which he had appointments 
        to the <br>
        staff of several Ministers, including Sir Charles Tupper.</p>
      <p>Volunteering to serve during the South African War, he took part in the 
        capture of <br>
        Pretoria, and guerrilla operations in the Orange Free State and the Transvaal. 
        On return <br>
        to Canada he was transferred to the staff of the Militia Department, and 
        in 1907 was <br>
        appointed to the Canadian Permanent Staff. During the First World War 
        he again <br>
        volunteered for active service, was promoted to Colonel, and served in 
        staff roles in <br>
        Canada, Bermuda and St. Lucia. </p>
      <p>On retirement in 1922 he was promoted to Brigadier-General, maintained 
        an active <br>
        involvement with military matters, and increased his involvement with 
        the Dominion of <br>
