      A major hotelier, market gardener, gold prospector, brickyard owner, school 
      trustee, alderman, land speculator and investor, John Graham was one of 
      the earliest landowners in the Ottawa East Village area. He and his family 
      played a major role in the evolution of the community from the 1860's to 
      the end of the century. 
      <p>The son of Andrew Graham (born about 1806), his father had emigrated 
        to Canada in <img src="../Image%20Library/People/X_John%20Graham.jpg" width="147" height="213" align="right" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="John Graham  June 6, 1830 - March 24, 1896 - Drawing from obituary.">1826 
        from the Irish County of Fermanagh where his family had been land owners 
        involved in agriculture. He settled in Carleton County and soon married 
        Eliza Alexander for the County Tyrone in Ireland. Originally in farming 
        and lumbering, Andrew moved to Ottawa in 1847 opening a hotel at the corner 
        of Rideau and Nicholas Streets later amalgamating this activity with the 
        grocery business.</p>
      <p>John was born in Nepean Township on June 6, 1830. At fourteen John was 
        articled to the Wilson Brothers who taught him the basics of business. 
        He later took over his father's business but eventually left to seek his 
        fortune in the California gold fields. After three years in the mining 
        business he became ill with &quot;the fever&quot;. He recovered and ultimately 
        returned to Canada in 1859 with enough money to open the Albion Hotel 
        across from the Court House on Daly St. He later owned other hotels including 
        the Grand Union and one located at Billings Bridge that he bought for 
        his father in 1870. The land he owned in Ottawa East (Graham Avenue from 
        Main to the canal) was put to good use growing vegetables for his hotels. 
        He gave up control of the Grand Union Hotel in 1894 due to ill health 
        and concentrated on his Ottawa East brickyard, farm and investments in 
        various macadam road companies. </p>
      <p>The 1881 Census shows him as a hotel keeper living with his first wife 
        Sarah Ann (born about 1839). All of their children died young. He remarried 
        to Violette, a widow. His death certificate lists the informant as Alexander 
        Graham, stepson.</p>
      <p>In 1895 he built Ardagh Square (45 Main St.), a large home surrounded 
        by trees, flowers and vegetables gardens. The house was ultimately purchased 
        in 1923 by the Roman Catholic School Board and became the first De Mazenod 
        School. The records show that he invested in the land where the Graham 
        Brickyard was operated but the business appears to have been run by his 
        stepson Alexander</p>
      <p>The Graham Brickworks was located on Clegg St. between Main St. and the 
        Rideau River. It is very difficult to pinpoint the actual location given 
        that village records for assessment no longer exist. As with Horace O'Dell's 
        brickyard, it must have been located near the river with its extensive 
        deposits of clay and sand. Ontario Land Records (Instrument #10485) indicated 
        that John Graham leased land in Lot I, Concession D (Brantwood Beach area) 
        in the early 1880's for the purpose of excavating clay for the manufacture 
        of brick and tile. A further lease was signed in 1896 between Alexander 
        Graham and the Kane family. This document (Instrument #17333) set the 
        rent at $1,000 per year and limited the production to &quot;not . . . 
        more than three and one-half million of brick or tile&quot; during the 
        time of the lease (10 years). There is more on this topic of making bricks 
        and the Ottawa East brickyards located <a href="../Modern_History_after_1907/Bricks.htm">here</a>.</p>
      <p>The earliest reference to this brickyard in the municipal directory of 
        1890-91. It was listed as the Gamman and Graham Company on the east side 
        of the macadamized road (Main St.). This must have been the office. The 
        owners were identified as Thomas Gamman (111 Main St.) and Alexander Graham 
        (45 Main St., John's stepson), both living on the same road. The Ontario 
        Land Records show an 1896 lease of property in Concession D, Lot I (<a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_Conc_lots_base.jpg">see 
        map here</a>) to Alexander Graham from four people including John Cain. 
        This may be the John P. Cain who later started the Cain Brick Company 
        in the same location first listed in the directory in 1906. The Gamman 
        and Graham Company is listed in 1906 and in 1907, Thomas Gammon was shown 
        as a brickmaker at 132 Main St. with Alexander Graham as a cement block 
        manufacturer at 58 Main St. </p>
      <p>John Graham died on March 24, 1896. Both the Ottawa Citizen and Ottawa 
        Journal printed large detailed obituaries of the man that detailed a very 
        interesting life.</p>
