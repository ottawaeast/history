    <td>A prominent and widely known and respected figure in Ottawa, Mr. James 
      Ballantyne one of the founders of the J. and T. Ballantyne Company, fuel 
      dealers, died last night (Monday April 6, 1925) at his home, 54 Main St., 
      Ottawa East. With the passing of Mr. Ballantyne, a host of warm friends 
      lose a great personal friend who ever held their deepest admiration and 
      respect, and his death will cast a shadow of regret over many Ottawa homes 
      today. 
      <p>Although widely known in all parts and sections of the city, Mr. Ballantynes 
        chief circle of interest lay in Ottawa East, where he had lived for half 
        a century, and in which district he had always taken an active interest.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ballantyne, who was ninety years of age, was born at Newcastleton, 
        Scotland, on Monday March 9, 1835, a son of Mr. And Mrs. Frank Ballantyne. 
        When he was only about five years of age, he came to Canada with his parents 
        in 1840 and settled with them on a farm near Smiths Falls. During the 
        early years of his life, he lived near Smiths Falls, engaging to a considerable 
        extent in building and contracting. He received his early education in 
        public and private schools.<br>

    <td>In 1863 he came to Ottawa, and established a barrel factory on Green Island, 
      New Edinburgh, which was later destroyed by fire. From there he moved to 
      what is now Ottawa East, where in conjunction with his brother Thomas, he 
      erected a factory and engaged in manufacturing cooperage stock and other 
      wood products. In the year 1890, the sale of coal was taken up and Adam 
      and Arthur Ballantyne, sons of James and Thomas Ballantyne respectively, 
      entered the business. In succeeding years, the business passed into their 
      management entirely. 
      <p>While both the original members of the firm are now passed, the firm 
        still carries on under the old name, under the direction of Mr. Ballantynes 
        sons. Mr. Thomas Ballantyne died two years ago.</p>
      <p>When Mr. Ballantyne moved to Ottawa East, which was before the village 
        was annexed by the city, Ottawa East was only a small centre. Mr. Ballantyne 
        took an intense interest in municipal and civic affairs, and was one of 
        the leading citizens of the town. He was reeve of the village of Ottawa 
        East for seven consecutive years, and an active worker in all betterment 
        plans and projects. Mr. Ballantyne and others, including Messrs. A.W. 
        Fleck, D.M. Finnie and B. Slattery, were behind the establishment of a 
        system of waterworks for the village. At the time of annexation the system 
        was taken over by the city.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ballantyne was active not only in civic and municipal politics, but 
        also in county politics. He was a member of the Carleton County Council 
        for nine years and warden for one year. In provincial and federal politics 
        his leanings were with the Liberal Party. In religion he was a member 
        of the Unitarian Church and was broadly tolerant.</p>
      <p> He celebrated his ninetieth birthday on March 9 inst., and throughout 
        his life enjoyed good health. His death came suddenly and unexpectedly. 
        On Wednesday April 1 last he was working in his garden and on Thursday 
        he was forced to take to his bed.</p>
      <p>His wife, formerly Mary Foster of Smiths Falls, died 49 years ago Sunday 
        April 5.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ballantyne is survived by two sons, Messrs. Norman and Adam Ballantyne 
        of Ottawa, now carrying on the firm of J. and T. Ballantyne, and one daughter, 
        Miss May Ballantyne, at home. Also living are two brothers, Frank of New 
        York State and Elliott, of Smiths Falls, and one sister, Miss Agnes, of 
        Smiths Falls.</p>
      <p>The funeral service will be held at 9:30 Wednesday morning at the home. 
        The body will be taken to the Central Depot, thence to Smiths Falls for 
        interment.</p>

      <p>A wide circle of friends will learn with regret of the death early this 
        morning at her home, 54 Main Street, of Miss Isa May Ballantyne, daughter 
        of the late James Ballantyne who died in 1925 and who was long identified 
        with the public life of Ottawa east before its annexation to the city. 
        Though suffering from serious illness for several weeks, Miss Ballantyne 
        exhibited a rare spirit at unselfishness and enterprise.</p>
      <p>Even near the end, her thoughts were frequently directed to the rendering 
        of some service for others. Having moved with her family when a child 
        from New Edinburgh to the new home then just completed, in the autumn 
        of 1873, she resided continuously for more than fifty-five years in the 
        same house. At an early age she became connected with the Congregational 
        church and Sunday school at the corner of Elgin and Albert streets, now 
        known as the First United Church on Florence Street. During the Intervening 
        years she was active in various branches of work in that organization. 
        Versatile in her interests and attainments, hers was a busy and fruitful 
        life. She was a lover of good literature who possessed a highly cultured 
        mind. When a young women music and painting claimed considerable of her 
        attention. In the latter are she displayed exceptional talent and ability, 
        as exemplified in a number of excellent productions. Flowers and birds 
        had a special interest for her also. Of these she had made quite a close 
        study and was well informed of regarding them. For many years she was 
        an enthusiastic attendee at the excursions and lectures under the auspices 
        of the Ottawa Field Naturalists' Club.</p>
      <p>A brief sojourn occasionally at her cottage on Big Island in Blue Sea 
        Lake afforded a welcome opportunity to observe the feathered life of that 
        region, as well as to enjoy the peacefulness and beauty there. She was 
        especially attached to the large old-fashioned garden at her home where, 
        throughout most of the season, might be seen a wealth and variety of bloom. 
        Her she loved to entertain friends, being always desirous that they should 
        share the garden with her and many testify to the happy hours spent as 
        her guests. Children of whom she was ever fond, were not overlooked in 
        her hospitality. They too knew the spacious grounds as scenes of frolic 
        and picnic. The district in which she lived particularly will feel that 
        a great loss has been sustained in her demise. Watchful and ready at all 
        times to be of assistance in undertakings in the common zeal she was an 
        exemplary citizen and was credited with innumerable acts of kindness performed 
        in a quiet and unobtrusive way. It truth it may be justly said of her 
        that she leaves behind a memory &quot;fragrant with good deeds&quot;. 
        There remain two brothers, Norman F. Ballantyne of Hawthorne avenue and 
        Adam of Clemow Avenue: also three cousins vis. Mrs. John Elliott who resided 
        with her, Henry F. Ballantyne of Hawthorne avenue and J. Arthur Ballantyne 
        of Patterson Avenue.</p>
      <p>Interment will be made in Beechwood cemetery on Tuesday May 7. </p>

        Death of Mr. Thomas Ballantyne Occurs in 87th Year of His Age<br>

    <td>Ottawa has lost one of its veteran businessmen in the passing of Mr. Thomas 
      Ballantyne, which occurred this morning at his home, 145 Echo Drive, in 
      his 87th year. He was a member of a family, which has done much for the 
      development of the city, particularly the district known as Ottawa East. 
      <p>Born at Newcastleton Scotland in 1873, Thomas Ballantyne came to Canada 
        at the age of 14 years with his family. The family, comprising ten sons 
        and three daughters, lived for some time near Smiths Falls. In his younger 
        days, Thomas Ballantyne worked with his father as a mason and later went 
        to Prescott where he learned the machinist trade. In the early sixties, 
        he moved to Merrickville and with his brother James established the firm 
        of J. and T. Ballantyne, which has continued in business without interruption 
        since that time, prior to 1890 in the manufacture of barrels and barrel 
        materials, and since that date in the coal business. The business expanded 
        from Merrickville to Ottawa and in 1871, property was purchased on Echo 
        Drive as a convenient place for shipping on the Rideau Canal. Since that 
        time Mr. Ballantyne was a resident of Ottawa East and has seen it grow 
        from a small settlement until it formed an important part of the city 
        of Ottawa.</p>
      <p>In 1868 while residing in Merrickville, Mr. Ballantyne married and was 
        predeceased by his wife in 1918. He leaves three sons: Messrs. Henry F., 
        J. Arthur and Dr Charles T. Ballantyne, all of Ottawa; three brothers, 
        Mr James Ballantyne of Ottawa who is in his 89th year; Mr. Frank Ballantyne 
        of Alexandria Bay, and Mr. Elliott Ballantyne.<br>
