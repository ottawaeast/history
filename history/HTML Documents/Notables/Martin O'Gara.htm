        men in the Ottawa Community during the last 40 years of the Nineteenth 
        Century. As a resident of Ottawa East he made a significant contribution 
        to the evolution of the community.</p>
      <p>Born in County Mayo Ireland on October 28, 1836, O'Gara immigrated to 
        Canada in 1857 and immediately entered into the study of law. By 1861 
        he was practicing in Ottawa and in 1863 he was appointed as police magistrate, 
        a position he held until his death along with the title of Police Commissioner.</p>
      <p>If the size of his obituary indicated his importance in the legal community, 
        the O'Gara was at the top of his profession. The Ottawa Evening Journal 
        devoted more than three full-page columns to his passing Along with an 
        artist's sketch, the story included a history of his life and numerous 
        accolades and tributes from lawyers, judges, police and politicians. The 
        entire extensive text of a special motion by the city council, paying 
        tribute to him and a description of the route his coffin would take was 
        also included. The Dominion Police, fireman and the band of the 43rd Regiment 
        escorted the funeral. O'Gara was one important man!</p>
      <p>And he lived in Ottawa East on the northwest corner of Hawthorne and 
        Main. The land records show that was involved in the purchase of several 
        properties beginning in the mid-1860's. He received a Crown Patent (free 
        land) in May of 1969. The O'Gara family first appears in the 1880 Archville 
        municipal directory on the &quot;new road&quot; (Main) and was a next 
        door neighbour to James Ballantyne. The house and original configuration 
        of Hawthorne is shown on the Fire Insurance Map <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/Fire%20Insurance%20Maps/F_159_btm.jpg">here</a>.</p>

      <p>The 1881 Census shows that he had seven children and two servants (from 
        Ireland) living with him at the time. Two additional children were born 
        subsequently.</p>
      <p>O'Gara was a staunch Catholic and supported the church throughout his 
        life. Two of his sons became priests. His death was marked by special 
        services held by leading members of the clergy. Throughout his life he 
        was known as a very able lawyer, a &quot;just magistrate&quot; who used 
        &quot;common sense and a kind heart&quot; and &quot;one of the finest 
        types of cultured Irish gentlemen&quot;.</p>
      <p>Martin O'Gara died on June 26, 1899 in his home in Ottawa East.</p>
