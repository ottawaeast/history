    <td>The very first industry established in the Ottawa East area was the O'Dell 
      brickyard located on what is now Lees Avenue near Simcoe St. The location 
      was attractive to brickmakers because of the extensive clay and sand deposits 
      along the Rideau River as well as cheap land. As Ottawa grew so did the 
      demand for locally produced brick. With proximity to the canal and railways 
      (in the 1880's), the brickyard flourished. 
      <p>Horace Culver O'Dell was born in the United States about 1817 and emigrated 
        to Canada in the early 1860's. He first appears in the Nepean Assessment 
        Roll in 1865 as a tenant on land owned by the Stewarts. This roll also 
        lists an Amos O'Dell in 1863 as a non-resident. Perhaps this was brother 
        or father. By the 1880's O'Dell owned a large amount of property surrounding 
        the brickyard that was later sold for development. He died on March 4, 
        1891 in his home at 158 Nicholas St.</p>
