      <p><b>WILLIAM STEWART</b>, businessman, militia officer, politician, and 
        farmer; baptized 24 July 1803 in Carbost, near Loch Harport, Isle of Skye, 
        Scotland, son of Ranald Stewart and IsabeIla McLeod; m. 16 April 1838 
        Catherine Stewart of Cuidrach, Isle of Skye, and they had four sons and 
        five daughters; d. 21 March 1856 in Toronto.<br>
      </p>
      <p>WiIliam Stewart was 13 when he arrived at Quebec in 1816 with his nine 
        brothers and sisters, his widowed mother, his maternal grandmother, and 
        his uncle. The family proceeded to Upper Canada and settled in Lancaster 
        Township, Glengarry County, where William's education was rounded out 
        under the tutelage of army doctor Roderick Macleod. Stewart's first employment 
        was with a Montreal merchant, whom he represented at the sale of timber 
        rafts at Quebec in 1825. He spent the next two years at Longueuil before 
        moving in March 1827 to By town (Ottawa), then a construction camp. There, 
        in partnership with John G. McIntosh, Stewart acquired property adjoining 
        the projected route of the Rideau Canal and opened a store carrying dry 
        goods and supplies for timber shanties on the upper Ottawa River. Though 
        a teetotaller, he added a taproom to the store, ownership of which he 
        assumed in 1830 upon the death of his partner. Community-minded, Stewart 
        was elected one of the original councillors for By town in 1828. During 
        the cholera epidemics in 1832 and 1834 he made door-to-door surveys for 
        the board of health and later was one of the founders of the County of 
        Carleton General Protestant Hospital. He helped form the Bytown Association 
        for the Preservation of the Peace during the Shiner riots and was active 
        in the local militia.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the mid 1830s Stewart supervised, staffed, and equipped his own timber 
        shanties on the upper Ottawa and its tributaries and sold rafts of red 
        and white pine at Quebec. As a broker, he also financed small operators 
        and sold timber on their behalf. Fluent in English and Gaelic and with 
        a working knowledge of French, Stewart, a founding member of the Ottawa 
        Lumber Association, quickly became a spokesman for lumberers operating 
        above By town, especially on the need for appointing timber cullers independent 
        of both buyers and sellers. While in London in 1835, he presented a memorial 
        to the British government on behalf of Montreal merchants and By town 
        residents seeking improvements to navigation on the Ottawa. In London 
        again in 1838, he was examined by a committee of the House of Commons 
        on the feasibility of Charles Shirreff*'s proposed water route to Lake 
        Huron via the Ottawa, and later that year he had an interview with Lord 
        Durham [Lambton*] at Quebec on the matter. In 1839, acting as agent for 
        Louis- Theodore Besserer*, Stewart sold lots in what is now the Sandy 
        Hill district of Ottawa.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Upon the union of Upper and Lower Canada in 1841, Stewart ran for election 
        for By town against Stewart Derbishire*. Apparently at the suggestion 
        of Governor Lord Sydenham [Thomson*], who was backing Derbishire, James 
        Johnston*, Alexander James Christie*, and Robert Shirreff withdrew their 
        candidacies, but Stewart refused to retire. Though defeated he harboured 
        no grudge and assisted Derbishire in furthering local concerns. In 1843 
        Stewart was returned for nearby Russell in a colourful by-election campaign 
        during which he was escorted from By town by a uniformed volunteer fire 
        brigade. </p>

    <td> 
      <p><a name="Intensely"></a>Intensely loyal to the crown, Stewart won the 
        1844 general election in By town on a pledge to support &quot;the course 
        pursued by the illustrious Individual at the head of the Government,&quot; 
        Sir Charles Theophilus Metcalfe* .<br>
      </p>
      <p>During his years in the Legislative Assembly (1843-47), Stewart shepherded 
        through legislation regulating the culling and measurement of timber and 
        introduced a resolution calling for a start on a project to be known as 
        the Georgian Bay ship canal, an undertaking which his son McLeod would 
        urge at a future date but without success. In 1845 Stewart chaired the 
        committee that secured the return from the Board of Ordnance of land belonging 
        to Nicholas Sparks * , and the following year he drafted the bill to incorporate 
        By town. The boundaries in the bill, which Stewart later claimed reflected 
        those sanctioned by Lord Sydenham in 1841, left his farm outside the town 
        limits and thus subject to a lower tax rate. Stewart was also accused 
        of arranging the wards in By town so as to favour conservative ascendancy. 
        In the general election of 1847-48, the conservatives of By town for unknown 
        reasons abandoned &quot;sweet William,&quot; as the reform By town Packet 
        dubbed him, for John Bower Lewis*. But John A. Macdonald* had not lost<br>
        confidence in Stewart and, in the spring of 1849, urged him to &quot;organize 
        at once for By town, Russell, Prescott, and Carleton,&quot; should Lord 
        Elgin [Bruce*]<br>
        call a snap election during the upheaval caused by the passage of the 
        Rebellion Losses Bill. He became the candidate of the British American 
        League [see George Moffatt*] for By town but there was to be no election 
        until 1851, when he was defeated by reformer Daniel McLachlin*. He ran 
        for the last time in 1854 for Russell, again unsuccessfully.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the late 1840s Stewart had suffered financial set-backs. Reported 
        to be worth &pound;20,000 in 1846, he had invested heavily in lumber; 
        losses sustained as a result of a glutted market and tight credit during 
        1847-48 forced him to sell his crown timber permits to John EGAN and give 
        up his lumber business. By 1850 he had given up his store as well and 
        thereafter devoted his time to his duties as superintendent of common 
        schools for By town and to his farm. The latter ran west of the Rideau 
        River for two miles and adjoined the By town parcel owned by the heirs 
        of Lieutenant-Colonel John By*. Stewart won prizes for his saddle horses 
        and field crops and used the hustings to lecture farmers on methods of 
        fertilizing. In March 1856, while representing the city of Ottawa as a 
        special agent in Toronto, then the seat of government, he suddenly took 
        ill and died a few days later. With him at the end were Robert Bell* and 
        John Sandfield Macdonald*. The latter prepared Stewart's bedside will.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Stewart is best remembered for the wide range of his community activities, 
        including the following: he was a founding member of St Andrew' s (Presbyterian) 
        Church; vice-president of the Highland Society of Canada; director of 
        the By town Emigration Society; president of the Agricultural Society 
        of Carleton County; a member of the original By town board of trade; and 
        a director of the Bank of British North America. An ambitious businessman, 
        Stewart accumulated property in By town and in Carleton and Renfrew counties 
        despite his chronic complaint of financial difficulties. His letter-books 
        reveal the man: deeply religious, philanthropic, impatient with the shortcomings 
        of others yet a person to whom friends turned for advice. For poet WiIliam 
        Pittman Lett, Stewart was Ha man among old By town's men.&quot; </p>
