    <td>The funeral cortege which takes place tomorrow afternoon from Wildwood, 
      Ottawa East to Beechwood, will be remembered by those who witness it, as 
      the last sad rites of an honourable and useful man. 
      <p>It is about 30 years since Robert Lees, the subject of this sketch, built 
        for himself the quiet residence where on Monday last he breathed his last. 
        Mr. Lees had a natural taste for the quietude of a semi-country life, 
        and was moreover a lover of floral and horticultural pursuits, and for 
        many years he was a prominent amateur in local exhibition displays.<br>
        <br>
        His first law office was on George street opposite the Geological Museum, 
        afterwards removing to the corner of Rideau and Walker streets, the building 
        then occupied as a hotel by the late Thomas Mathews, and at present known 
        as the Rideau street convent. Here Mr. Lees practised his profession until 
        his appointment in 1857 to the clerkship of the peace and county crown 
        attorneyship, when his office was removed to the courthouse. These joint 
        offices he held from that date until the time of his death, 36 years. 
        It was in the Rideau street building that the late J. J. Gemmell studied 
        with Mr. Lees until Mr. Gemmell's death about four years ago. Mr. J.A. 
        Gemmell, barrister, also studied with Mr. Lees some years after the latter's 
        removal to the court house building.<br>
      </p>
      <p>MR. LEES IN BYTOWN<br>
        <br>
        It was in the troublous times of 1848 that Mr. Lees made Bytown his home. 
        Politically he was a Reformer - a Radical of the time - and the memory 
        of Canada's early government by compact and the vivid recollections of 
        '37 were still disturbing incidents in the history of the times. Mr. Lees, 
        for some years a school teacher, early espoused the cause of the Radicals 
        and when, in '49, after the stormy meeting and subsequent fight in By 
        ward market, a number of persons were arrested and tried for complicity 
        in the riot and murder, Mr. Lees took up the defence of the accused of 
        the Radical Party. These parties he ably defended and from that time on 
        became obnoxious in a measure to the &quot;super-loyal&quot; element of 
        the &quot;stormy Monday&quot; fracas. Feeling against Lord Elgin, our 
        then governor-general, for sanctioning the Rebellion Losses Bill, ran 
        high among the Tories and their loyal allies, and it was resolved that 
        the public meeting called by Mayor John Scott should not be allowed to 
        favour the approval of the measure. Hence the pulling down of the platform 
        and the subsequent fight which marks a distinct and regrettable period 
        in the history of our city.<br>
        <br>
        HIS SUBSEQUENT CAREER</p>
      <p>These incidents are mentioned because Mr. Lees, from his well-known political 
        leanings, and his having pleaded the cause of the accused, had become 
        a prominent figure in the affairs of the times, and because also on<br>
        more than one occasion he was threatened with violence for his out-spoken 
        words and his able defence of those brought before the court. </p>
      <p>But in due time quietness and a better feeling prevailed and the subject 
        of this sketch was reinstated in the minds and affections of all parties 
        as a quiet, respectable and unoffending citizen. Mr. Lees practised law 
        successfully, and after his appointment to office he dignified, by an 
        orderly life and by the application of high attainments in his profession, 
        the office conferred upon him by those in authority. </p>
      <p>To speak of the many honourable positions occupied by Mr. Lees in his 
        long and useful life in our midst would be superfluous, but while following 
        closely his professional duties he yet found time to devote to civic, 
        social and philanthropic efforts. For some years Mr. Lees was a member 
        of the city council, and his services as a legal advisor for the board 
        of management of the Protestant Orphans' Home from the date of its organization, 
        cannot be too highly spoken of, all professional services having been 
        given gratis.</p>
      <p>Having spoken of none of the more prominent events in the life of the 
        deceased during his long residence in Ottawa it is only necessary to say, 
        his family relationship and his youthful history having been yesterday 
        alluded to, that in the demise of Mr. Lees Ottawa has lost a good and 
        useful citizen and the government a faithful official.<br>
        <br>
        [On the same page of the scrapbook - dated in handwriting 1893]</p>
      <p>Mr. Robert Lees, Q.C. County Crown Attorney, died at his home here this 
        morning. Mr. Lees had been in poor health for some time, but last evening 
        he was taken seriously ill. Heart failure was the immediate cause of death. 
        Mr. Lees was one of the best known men in Ottawa and the County of Carleton. 
        He was born in Dalkeith, Scotland, and when a child came with his parents 
        to Canada in 1817, nearly 80 years ago. In 1819 his father became one 
        of the pioneer settlers of Lanark county, taking up land near Perth. Mr. 
        Lees was admitted as attorney in 1847 and called to the bar in 1848. He 
        leaves a family of one son and four daughters. Two of the daughters are 
        married, Mrs. R.D. Brown of Ottawa East, and Mrs. S. Preston, of Toronto. 
        The remaining daughters, Miss Victoria and Miss Jessie Lees, lived with 
        their father at the old homestead, Wildwood, Ottawa East. Mr. William 
        Lees, the only son, was in his father's office studying law. Mrs. Lees, 
        nee Miss Jessie Dickson, of Pakenham, died about seven years ago.</p>
