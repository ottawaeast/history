    <td>It is appropriate at this time to look into the early history of parish 
      development in Ottawa East, and to trace briefly the changes that have occurred 
      in parish structure since the first church was established to serve Catholics 
      in the area. It will give older parishioners a nostalgic glimpse of their 
      early days growing up with the parish. Others who have joined the parish 
      community in recent years may also be interested in how it all began.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>No doubt, parish roots go back far beyond the Ottawa that even the oldest 
      parishioners can recall, into those early By town days when the young settlement 
      consisted only of a few crude shanties huddled on the banks of the recently 
      completed Rideau Canal. It may be that, more than a century earlier, one 
      of the Holy Canadian Martyrs, whose memory is commemorated in the name of 
      the parish, paused briefly on his way to the Huron mission fields to perform 
      the first celebration of the Holy Eucharist in this area. The first priest 
      to serve in the new settlement of Bytown was assigned to duty here in 1827 
      from the already established community of Richmond. The first Catholic church 
      was built in By town in 1832 on the site of the present Basilica. Construction 
      of the present imposing edifice began some eight years later. Then, in 1846, 
      the parish of St. Patrick's was formed to serve the Catholics living on 
      the west side of the canal, in what was known as Upper Town.</td>

  <tr> 
    <td>With the arrival of the Oblate Fathers in Ottawa in 1844, and the coming 
      of Bishop Guigues as the first Bishop of the new diocese of Ottawa three 
      years later, the <img src="../../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/ssj_71.jpg" width="200" height="136" align="right" alt="University of Ottawa" vspace="5" hspace="5">Catholiccommunity 
      experienced a surge of activity that was to continue for many years. One 
      of the first actions of the Bishop was to request the Oblates of Mary Immaculate 
      to take over the operation and direction of Bytown College, which was eventually 
      to develop into the University of Ottawa. Then, in 1856, the Oblate Fathers 
      were called upon to form a new bilingual parish in Lower Town, to be known 
      as St. Joseph's. The community of Ottawa East was then known as Archville 
      and lay just beyond the limits of the newly formed city of Ottawa.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>The first parish priest of St. Joseph's was Father Alexandre Trudeau who 
      conducted the first services in the new parish church in 1856. St. Joseph's 
      was to continue as a bilingual parish for more than 30 years until the French-speaking 
      parish of Sacre Coeur was formed.</td>

      of their own, and the new parish of Holy Family was formed, again a bilingual 
      parish under the direction of the Oblate Fathers. On March 24, 1901, the 
      first services in the new parish were held in an old wooden building, located 
      on the Oblate property on Main Street, known at the time as the White House. 
      Shortly afterwards, construction was started on the new Holy Family Church 
      on a site on the south side of Oblate Avenue.</td>
