    <td>Canadian Martyrs has felt the effects of the ever-present force of change, 
      both those within people and groups and those from external sources. The 
      parish population differs today from former days due to a number of factors 
      including greater mobility, changes in the type, size, number and age span 
      of its families.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>In addition to the societal changes which have affected all the traditional 
      human institutions, the parish was dramatically affected by the changes 
      emanating from the 21st Ecumenical Council, Vatican 11, in 1962. After a 
      study of the 16 documents prepared by the Council, the Bishops of Canada 
      set about to have incorporated into the life of Canadian parishes the required 
      changes. The process of changing over would be gradual and the rate and 
      extent of change would vary from place to place. The task of undertaking 
      these changes in Canadian Martyrs parish was under the leadership of the 
      pastor of the day, Father Brennan. It was in March 1965 that Canadiar Martyrs 
      felt a major change. It was then that it dropped the use of Latin in the 
      celebration of Mass, and from then on, the Mass has been said in the vernacular.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Through the work of the Parish Council, parishioners are kept in touch 
      with the changing needs of the parish and are canvassed for their opinions 
      on matters requiring decision-making. For example, during the exile and 
      deplorable suffering of the peoples of Cambodia and Vietnam, parishioners 
      were asked if, and how, they wished to assist in the sponsorship of a family. 
      The response resulted in the parish supporting a family from Cambodia while 
      they settled in to their new life in Canada.</td>

  <tr> 
    <td>Over a century ago Cardinal Newman wrote &quot;to live is to change; to 
      be perfect is to have changed often&quot;. This insight into the nature 
      of human life is valid for people in any period of history, but those century-old 
      words are even more profound in this day. Life is not static; it moves relentlessly 
      on. Each is constantly either advancing into life or declining into death. 
      If the celebration of the parish 60th Anniversary has caused us to look 
      back over our history, it also calls us to assess where we are as a parish 
      at present, and what direction we see our parish taking towards the future 
      - towards new life.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>The renewal of the Catholic Church as set in motion by Vatican Council 
      11 is a continuing development involving adaptation and adjustment to the 
      many new and varied situations and realities of the latter part of the 20th 
      century. It is our profound conviction, based on the promise of Jesus, that 
      the changes which the Church is called upon to make at any given moment 
      of its history are not simply based on the arbitrary choice of church leaders, 
      but rather upon the presence, inspiration and guidance of the Holy Spirit. 
      For some, the changes in the Church pose a continued problem of acceptance 
      or rejection; others see in these an ever-renewed challenge of the Spirit 
      to discover and continually rediscover how our Christian faith and life 
      can be more attractive and meaningful in different times and to different 
      people.<br>
