    <td>The parish too, in a sincere effort to keep abreast with the call of the 
      Church to spiritual renewal, and responding to the changing needs of our 
      Christian community, has had to change and adapt. During the 50's and 60's, 
      the parish community was made up of many who came from outside the actual 
      parish boundaries, calling for certain types of service. For example, there 
      were three or four priests and a brother stationed in the parish and five 
      or six masses on Sunday were needed. With the escalated immigration to the 
      city and rapid development of suburbs during the late '50's and 60's, several 
      new parishes were formed in the south end of the city (Immaculate Heart 
      of Mary and Resurrection of our Lord). This diminished the numbers attending 
      our parish and decreased the need for as many priests and the frequency 
      of religious services. The number of priests resident in the parish was 
      decreased to two, and then to one, the pastor.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>At the same time as there was a decrease in the number of priests attached 
      to the parish, there developed an increased awareness of the need for the 
      laity to take a more active leadership role in the activities of the parish.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Some years ago, the parish was seen as the centre of the spiritual and 
      social life of the community. In more recent times, with many social activities 
      initiated by other organizations and groups, the parish has been called 
      upon to promote the development of a deeper spiritual community, a profoundly 
      conscious Christian community, which manifests the reality of the living 
      Christ in the world in which we live. And making Christ present means that 
      His vision of being redeemed is consciously celebrated within the comforting 
      and supportive context of Christian brotherhood and friendship. We are attempting 
      to develop more fully that sense of Christian community through more participated 
      liturgies, through study groups such as Genesis 11, and Christian community 
      building workshops, through a more active participation of parents, relatives 
      and friends in the preparation of children for the sacraments. On a number 
      of occasions, our parish has joined with other Churches, Catholic and neighbouring 
      ones of other denominations, in the conduct of religious services for the 
      community. In the spirit of ecumenism, there is a cooperative attitude of 
      neighbourliness and assistance among churches and citizens in the district.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>All see the parish as having changed over the years, and of having changed 
      even quite profoundly. This change has not always been easy to accept. But, 
      under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, perhaps there is recovered in our 
      day an important understanding of the word &quot;catholic&quot; which means 
      &quot;universal&quot;. Ours is a church with a broad expanse. The essentials 
      remain the same for all who profess the faith. Non-essentials can be changed 
      to reflect the differences universality brings. We are one church with one 
      profession of faith. But that one faith is immersed in situations and circumstances 
      according to different times<br>
      and cultures and peoples, which demand adaptation and change.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>On this, the occasion of our 60th Anniversary, we the people of Canadian 
      Martyrs Parish reiterate the words of Cardinal Newman &quot;to live is to 
      change; to be perfect is to have changed often&quot;. We acknowledge that 
      we are not as yet perfect as a parish but we are changing and are willing 
      to continue to change toward sanctity and we look with confidence to the 
      future.
