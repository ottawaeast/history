    <td>Early in 1957, at the request of the Pastor, Father Herlihy, the Canadian 
      Martyrs Conference of the Society was established in the parish. The purpose 
      of the Society was to supply food, clothing, furniture, etc. to the poor 
      families in the parish as well as to give counseling in the management of 
      their affairs.</td>

    <td>The Holy Name Society was one of the first to be formed in the new parish. 
      The main objective of the Society was the promotion of the spiritual welfare 
      of the men of the parish. As the new parish grew, the Society grew with 
      it and became an important element in the development of the parish community. 
      Activities such as regular communion breakfasts, an annual outdoor public 
      rally and closed retreats were features of its program.</td>

  <tr> 
    <td>During the 35 years that the Holy Name Society was active in the parish, 
      it provided inestimable spiritual benefits and fellowship in good works 
      for its members. Along with its other activities, the Society provided the 
      nucleus for a men's parish club, known as the Canadian Martyrs Taxpayers' 
      Association. This group dealt effectively with many of the temporal affairs 
      of the parish and aided in the support of the parish through sponsorship 
      and operation of parish social events such as bingos and bazaars.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>A factor which led to the decline in activity of the Holy Name Society 
      was the growing need for greater recognition of the family unit in the Church 
      and in society generally. New organizations came into being, such as the 
      Christian Family Movement, Cursillo, Marriage Encounter, prayer groups, 
      etc. Although the Society has become inactive in this archdiocese, it continues 
      to flourish elsewhere. However, the annual retreat program, begun by the 
      Holy Name Society, continues to be a popular event in the archdiocese.</td>

      Other spiritual directors have been: Fathers Kevin McNamara and D.J. Brennan,

      members by prayer and active cooperation. The spirit of the Legion is that

      shut-ins in their homes, in local hospitals, nursing and retirement homes.

      work performed during the past week.<br>
