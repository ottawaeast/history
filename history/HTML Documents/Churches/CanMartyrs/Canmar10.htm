      bulletins, the first being issued on November 3, 1946, when Father Herlihy

      with its changes in life styles and codes of conduct, began about 30 years 
      ago. The Church, sensing the need to modify some of its structures to keep 
      abreast of the changing times, introduced a number of rather drastic changes.</td>

    <td>Using the guidelines set forth in Vatican 11, the Assembly of Canadian 
      Martyrs was founded in 1969 with the appointment of an interim Parish Council. 
      Under the leadership of Father McNamara, the interim council prepared to 
      assume the enhanced responsibilities of the laity. At the first Parish Assembly, 
      held on February 22, 1970, the activities of the interim council were reported, 
      a draft constitution and a financial report for the parish were presented 
      and discussed and a Parish Council executive was elected. Committees were 
      set up to deal with the main areas of concern - constitution, finance, liturgy, 
      social activities and youth programs.</td>

    <td>In its 20 years of existence in Canadian Martyrs Parish, the Parish Council, 
      under the guidance of the various resident pastors, has more than fulfilled 
      its mandate to encourage the involvement of the laity in parish affairs, 
      and to provide for the special needs of the people and the community in 
      fields of education, catechetic, welfare, social advancement, etc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>In addition to the core committees of finance and liturgy, groups which 
      attend to the special needs of the community have also been established. 
      These include the Grief Support Group, Development and Peace, contact with 
      the Shepherds of Good Hope and our Sandwich Makers, Baptismal and Pre--Marriage 
      Counseling, Pastoral Care and Rectory Volunteers and those concerned with 
      the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults, Eucharistic Ministers Altar 
      Servers and Lectors, to name a few. All of these groups, under the wise 
      counseling of Father Conlon, have made Canadian Martyrs Parish a place where 
      the laity of all environments and associations can meet to celebrate the 
      Eucharist and where the special needs of the people can be served. It must 
      be added that the Parish Council was used as the medium when a survey was 
      conducted in 1987 to determine whether the parish should continue to exist.</td>

    <td>An additional benefit to the Parish, which resulted from the Papal changes 
      in 1969, was the emergence of the role of Parish Assistants or Co-Ordinators. 
      Canadian Martyrs has had the dedicated service of three of these special 
      ministers - Miss Roslyn Brown, Miss Anne-Marie Bazinet and Sr. Joan Whittingham 
      S. P., each of whom has contributed her own talents and special interests 
      to assist in the spiritual works of the parish.</td>
