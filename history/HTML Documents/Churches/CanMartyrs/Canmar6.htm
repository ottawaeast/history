      was appointed pastor. One of 11 children, Father Kroetch was born in the 
      small farming community of Strome, Alta. He received his early education 
      in Alberta and later studied at the Oblate Novitiate at Arnprior and at 
      Holy Rosary Scholasticate at Orleans. He was ordained on June 26,1965 in 
      his home parish of St. Agnes in Edmonton. Father Kroetch guided the 50th

      had a succession of &quot;caretaker&quot; pastors under an Oblate Administrator, 
      each of whom directed his energies to the maintenance of parish life. This 
      period, however, also saw changes in the parish community - fewer young 
      people, families moving to the suburbs and the older parishioners moving 
      to nursing homes. At the same time, there was an acute shortage of priests 
      due to the heavy demand made upon the Oblates in their vast mission fields 
      in our north country as well as in South America.</td>
