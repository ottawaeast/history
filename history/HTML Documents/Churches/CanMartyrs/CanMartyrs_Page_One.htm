      <p>As detailed in the history of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate (<a href="../../../scholasticate.htm">found 
        here</a>), the arrival of this Order in the Ottawa area in the 1840's 
        was the precursor of the eventual formation of the Ottawa East Catholic 
        community. The leadership of the Oblates created institutions such as 
        the University of Ottawa, St. Paul University and St. Patrick's College 
        and churches such as Ste. Famille and Canadian Martyrs.</p>
      <p>The history of Canadian Martyrs Church, reproduced below with the kind 
        permission of Father Carl Kelly, OMI, was written by church parishioners 
        for the 50th Anniversary and updated for the 60th Anniversary. As mentioned 
        in the document, a Special Committee headed by Anne Burns did the original 
        work. The document was scanned and then converted to text using Optical 
        Character Recognition. Some of the material and photos were omitted but 
        the material here has been reproduced as faithfully as possible. Where 
        possible additional photographs have been added to enhance the reader's 
        understanding. The original document is held in the church archive. We 
        are indeed fortunate to have this documentation of an integral part of 
        the history of Ottawa East.<br>
