    <td>In the Spring of 1954, with the encouragement of Father Herlihy, a group 
      of parishioners began a series of home workshops to familiarize themselves 
      with the history, the philosophy and the mechanics of credit union operation. 
      After several weeks of preparation, application was made to the Government 
      of Ontario for a charter for the new credit union. The charter was granted 
      on July 14, 1954, and the parish credit union came into being. Members' 
      savings were used to make provident loans to members needing financial assistance.</td>

    <td>The Federation of Catholic Parent-Teacher Association of Ontario was established 
      in 1949 and diocesan councils and local PTA's were formed within the next 
      year. The basic function of these associations was to promote the development 
      of a better Catholic school system by bridging the gap between home and 
      school and by obtaining much needed financial aid from the provincial government.</td>

  <tr> 
    <td>With Father Herlihy as spiritual director, and the strong support of Miss 
      Cecilia Rowan, principal of Canadian Martyrs School for many years, the 
      local Parent-Teacher Association was formed. For many years, the PTA, through 
      the diocesan council and the federation, pressed for greater provincial 
      aid to Separate Schools and for improvements at the municipal level, including 
      expansion of physical education facilities in the Separate Schools. A notable 
      accomplishment at the federation level was the introduction of the Christopher 
      course to provide Catholic laity with an opportunity to learn the techniques 
      of leadership.</td>

      were carried on by a Parent Advisory Committee which was formed on the initiative 
      of the principal of Canadian Martyrs School. It endeavoured to help out, 
      where possible, in the smooth operation of the school by providing a means 
      of coordination between the teaching staff and the parents.</td>

      the issuance of an official charter by the Ottawa District Council Scout 
      Headquarters. This followed a considerable amount of preparatory work by 
      a group of dedicated parish members who later formed the first Scout Group 
      Committee in the parish. Father Herlihy, as in so many cases, had been the 
      moving spirit in having this service set up for the boys of his new parish.<br>
