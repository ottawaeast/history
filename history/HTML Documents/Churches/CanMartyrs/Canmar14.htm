    <td>Canadian Martyrs is one of the relatively few parishes of the Archdiocese 
      to be served by a religious order. Parishioners owe a great deal to the 
      Oblates of Mary Immaculate for their administration and spiritual guidance 
      of the parish from its beginning. Through the Oblates, the life and work 
      of Canadian Martyrs Church and St. Patrick's College were intertwined. The 
      two flourished under the able hand of the Oblate priests. Both the parish 
      and college served the spiritual needs of people in their respective community 
      and academic interests. The parish was richly served by the help of academic 
      principals, faculty and the presence and participation of students and their 
      parents. It was often stated that young persons living in Ottawa East could 
      receive, if so inclined, their elementary, secondary and college education 
      without leaving the family home e.g. Father Laurie Conlon.</td>

    <td>It was the Oblates who initiated the parish's special devotion to the 
      Virgin Mary, their patron. Among the 50th Anniversary celebrations was the 
      rededication of Our Lady's Shrine situated at the left front side of the 
      church. The statue was restored to its original beauty and the shrine completely 
      refurbished. The parish is indebted to Father Archie Daley, who, in anticipation 
      of the Jubilee, was able to secure funds to have this restoration work done. 
      It was through the hard work, commitment and artistic skills of Father Toby 
      McGivern and parishioner Mr. Joe O'Reilly that this Jubilee project was 
      completed. The beautiful marble statue was donated to the parish by the 
      late Mr. and Mrs. William Bruder who were among the founding parishioners.</td>
