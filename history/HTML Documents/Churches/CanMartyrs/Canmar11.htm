    <td>Like the Church, the school had a humble beginning and its development 
      over the years followed much the same course. Starting at the turn of the 
      century, it too was a bilingual institution and had the parish name of Holy 
      Family. In 1923 de Mazenod School was established for the French-speaking 
      section and Holy Family continued as an English-speaking school. In 1930, 
      when the new parish was founded, the name of the school was changed to Canadian 
      Martyrs and Sister St. Gregory of the Grey Sisters of the Immaculate Conception 
      became the first principal. One year later Miss Cecilia Rowan became principal 
      and continued in this position until 1957.</td>

    <td>Some parishioners may recall the happy years spent in this little old 
      school. A unique feature of the building was the fire escape system which 
      consisted of two open iron poles extending to the ground from the windows 
      of the second floor classrooms. Many an adventurous boy took this route 
      when making an unannounced departure while the teacher was out of the room.</td>

  <tr> 
    <td>The boys' yard at the back of the school was surrounded by a high wooden 
      fence behind which some were to experience their first puff of a cigarette. 
      In winter, a popular pastime on the way to school was to get a ride on a 
      horse -drawn sleigh going up or down Main Street. Sometimes, on a nice day, 
      one might forget to get off at the school only to have to face the music 
      later when returning long after the bell had rung.</td>

    <td>Highlights of the school term were the annual picnic and the Christmas 
      party. For quite a few years the picnics were held either at Aylmer or Britannia 
      Park, both places being served by the electric street railway. In later 
      years, Brantwood Park was the site used and although it was much more convenient, 
      the glamour of the long streetcar ride was missing.</td>

      consisted of a concert of songs and recitations by the pupils followed by 
      the appearance of Santa Claus who always had a present for everyone.</td>

    <td>The end came for the little red schoolhouse in the fall of 1943 when it 
      was destroyed by fire. Fortunately the fire broke out at noon-time when 
      the pupils were out of the building and although it was brought under control, 
      the building was damaged beyond repair.</td>

    <td>F or the next four years t-he parish was without a school building, a 
      result of the wartime shortage of structural steel. During that time classes 
      were held in other schools wherever accommodation could be found, including 
      St. Patrick's College, Lady Evelyn Public School, Elgin Street Public School, 
      de Mazenod and even the basement of the church. These were trying times 
      for students and teachers alike but Miss Rowan managed to maintain a good 
      semblance of order and guided her school through the difficulty.</td>

      and example, the noble principles of Catholic living and teaching.<br>
