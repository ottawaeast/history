      many of the families experienced difficult times. However, the hard times 
      seemed to draw the parish family closer together. Weekly card parties held 
      in the basement of the church were well attended and the annual bazaars 
      and teas were always successful. Two important organizations were active 
      during this period, the Catholic Women's League and the Holy Name Society. 
      Both have played a vital role in the spiritual and social development of 
      the parish. .</td>

      developments in the southern part of Ottawa East resulted in a large increase 
      in the parish family. Due to ill health, Father Doran was forced to retire 
      from the parish in 1944. From that time until mid 1945, Father Joseph Scannell 
      O.M.I., a gifted speaker and highly respected priest, served the parish. 
      Father Scannell was very popular among the religious and lay communities 
      alike, resulting in his services being sought for the conducting of missions 
      and retreats.</td>

    <td>By 1950 it had become apparent that the little church at the corner of 
      Main and Lees could no longer accommodate the growing congregation. Standing 
      room had become the lot of any latecomers at Sunday mass. On special occasions, 
      such as midnight mass at Christmas, a second service would have to be held 
      in the basement of the church. A move to a larger church became an urgent 
      priority, and a parcel ofland adjoining St. Patrick's <a href="../../Image%20Library/People/X_canmar_ground_break.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/People/sm/X_canmar_ground_break_sm.jpg" width="175" height="141" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Sod breaking at the neew Canadian Martyrs" border="0"></a>College 
      was obtained from the Oblate Order. This would be used as the site for a 
      new and larger church. On November 17, 1952, the first sod was turned. The 
      cornerstone was laid on May 18, 1953, and was blessed by Bishop Lajeunesse 
      O.M.I., Vicar Apostolic of Keewatin. Later that year, the first mass in 
      the new church was celebrated at midnight on Christmas Eve, and a few weeks 
      later, the 24th anniversary of the founding of the parish, the new church 
      was blessed by Archbishop Lemieux, O.P.</td>

      stained-glass window over the main altar was donated by the Doran family, 
      and was designed and made by Theo Lubbers, a Dutch artist living in Montreal. 
      He also designed the side windows depicting the Way of the Cross: The large 
      stained-glass window over the altar symbolizes a wealth of Canadian religious 
      history. It shows the missionary martyrs grouped about Mary, Queen of the 
      World, who is holding her Divine Son. St. John de Brebeuf holds a sacred 
      book on which is inscribed the Jesuit motto &quot;Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam&quot;(To 
      the greater glory of God), while below the Oblate Cross is the Canadian 
      motto &quot;A Mari Usque Ad Mare&quot; (From Sea to Sea). Canadian Martyrs 
      was Father Herlihy's first parish and he was the key priest in the development 
      of the parish in its young, vibrant years.</td>
