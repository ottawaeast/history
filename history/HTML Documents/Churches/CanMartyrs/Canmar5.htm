    <td>Following Father Herlihy's term, Father Gerald Cousineau O.M.I. was appointed 
      pastor on July 1, 1959. An Ottawa native, he also grew up in St. Joseph's 
      parish and graduated from the University of Ottawa. Although he served for 
      only three years, Father Cousineau <a href="../../Image%20Library/Buildings/Schools/CA%204048_StPats.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/Buildings/Schools/sm/CA%204048_StPats_sm.jpg" width="200" height="81" align="right" alt="St. Patrick's College in 1954" border="0"></a>took 
      on the responsibility of building a new rectory for the parish. A tireless 
      worker in Christian education, his efforts have been felt throughout the 
      parish and city. At St. Patrick's College, Father Cousineau had been teacher, 
      principal and rector. He was appointed Provincial of the Oblate Fathers 
      in 1962, a position he held until 1968. He was then appointed Pastor of 
      St. Joseph's Church and in 1971 returned to Canadian Martyrs as Assistant 
      Pastor. During his long association with Canadian Martyrs Parish, Father 
      Cousineau won the hearts of the parishioners, and in March 1980, a farewell 
      party was given in his honour, at which time the parish wished him a happy, 
      healthy, well-earned retirement.</td>

  <tr> 
    <td>Father Donald Brennan O.M.I., who was an assistant to Father Cousineau, 
      was appointed pastor in 1962 and remained in that office until November 
      1968. Father Brennan graduated from St. Patrick's College after having received 
      his early education in Maniwaki, P. Q., where he was born. He was very popular 
      with the young people of the parish and dedicated much time to their welfare. 
      Regular weekly meetings were held for both senior and junior members of 
      the Catholic Youth Organization (C. Y.O.). He also organized hockey teams 
      among the altar boys. It was during Father Brennan's term of office that 
      the many changes, resulting from Vatican 11, were to take place, a heavy 
      responsibility for a young priest serving his first pastorate. His hobby 
      was growing flowers which was very apparent from the beautiful arrangements 
      of shrubs, roses and annuals decorating the church grounds.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Father Kevin McNamara O.M.I. succeeded Father Brennan. He was appointed 
      pastor on November 18, 1968, after serving for a year as assistant to Father 
      Brennan. A former federal public servant who chose a religious life, Father 
      McNamara brought with him a vast knowledge and experience in the field of 
      finance. Before coming to Canadian Martyrs, he served for several years 
      as bursar of St. Patrick's College. A native of Eganville, Ontario, a community 
      which has given a great number of its sons and daughters to the Church, 
      his background of small town friendliness was to make for an easy adjustment 
      to parish work. He served until August 15, 1974, during which time much 
      of his responsibility were the continuing adjustments to the many changes 
      resulting from Vatican 11. He also directed the formation of the first Parish 
      Council.</td>

    <td>On August 5, 1974, Father Archie Daley O.M.I. was appointed pastor. Another 
      son of <a href="../../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/OMI/SJ17_Oblatemadonna.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/OMI/sm/SJ17_Oblatemadonna.jpg" width="73" height="171" align="right" alt="Statue of the Madonna" border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5"></a>St. 
      Joseph's parish, Father Daley graduated from St. Patrick's College High 
      School and continued his religious education at Holy Rosary Scholasticate, 
      later going to Rome to study philosophy and theology. Upon his return, he 
      had many pastoral assignments throughout Canada and for a number of years 
      he was Director of Retreats at Villa Madonna Retreat House in Ottawa. A 
      most charitable man, he took special interest in the sick and the needy. 
      He left the parish on August 15, 1979, to serve as pastor of St. Bernard's 
      Church, Enfield, N. S.<br>
