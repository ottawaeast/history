    <td>As the Lord continued to bless the work, the need for more Sunday School 
      space became evident. On April 7, 1959, during the ministry of Pastor Olley, 
      the church voted<br>
      to established a building program, and a building committee was chosen consisting 
      of Messrs. C.R. Matheson, Reg Harmer, Jr., C.M. Miller, W.H. Cavey and Harold 
      Grierson. This committee recommended that an addition be erected on the 
      east side of the church consisting of two floors, one to provide Nursery 
      and Sunday School classes and the other to provide washroom and kitchen 
      facilities and additional Sunday School space. Folding doors off the main 
      auditorium would provide room for overflow seating capacity.
      <p>Mr. Norman Penney made a motion that when the building was erected, it, 
        or some portion of it, should be named the &quot;F.C. Blair Memorial Hall&quot; 
        in memory of Mr. Blair's faithful <br>
        and capable leadership in the church since its inception. This motion 
        was passed unanimously by the congregation. Mr. Blair was called into 
        the presence of the Lord on May 28, 1959. His influence on the lives of 
        all who were blessed by knowing him, cannot be overestimated.</p>
      <p>&quot;The F. C. Blair Memorial Hall&quot; was completed in 196O.</p>
      <p>In 1973, a Sunday School room on the east was redecorated and furnished 
        to be used as the Pastor's Study and office.</p>
      <p>In 1975 the platform area was removed and the pulpit was raised to the 
        choir area with approaches erected on the east and west sides. New carpeting 
        and drapes were also <br>
        installed at that time.</p>
      <p>The lot and house adjacent to the church on the south side, 115 Main 
        Street, was purchased in the 1960's. In 1976, this house was demolished 
        to provide for additional parking.</p>
