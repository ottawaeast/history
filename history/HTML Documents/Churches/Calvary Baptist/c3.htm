    <td>Early in 1908 the Ottawa Baptist Churches Board purchased the present 
      lot, on the corner of Main and Evelyn and built the present building to 
      house the new Mission. The work was carried on with local supply-preachers 
      and student-pastors during the summer months. During this time the Sunday 
      School flourished under local leadership. <br><br>
      A house which was on the lot when purchased, was moved to where the Blair 
      Memorial Hall now stands and was used as a parsonage until a new parsonage 
      was built across the street on the Northeast corner of Main and Evelyn in 
      1944-45. Rev. John Dempster was the first pastor to occupy this new home. 
      In 1975 this building was sold to private interests for $41,OOO.
      <p>About 1911, Rev. A.N. Frith became the first regular mission pastor, 
        serving both this mission and the one in Eastview under the Baptist Extension 
        Board.</p>
      <p><br>
        CALVARY BAPTIST CHURCH</p>
      <p>The Mission was organized into Calvary Baptist Church, April 22, 1915, 
        free from debt, when Rev. G.H. Harber became the pastor. There were 63 
        charter members of whom Mrs. A.P. Abolit, Mrs. J. Roberts and Mr. John 
        Fraser, are still members of the Church. The following Committee, Messrs. 
        G.H. Harber, John Meldrum and F.C. Blair, drew up a Constitution which 
        was adopted at that meeting.</p>
      <p>Rev. G.H. Harber - was the brother of Mrs. William Black, a faithful 
        worker for many years. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Black had been missionaries in Africa 
        but had returned to Canada because of Mr. Black's health. Mrs. Black's 
        involvement in the Sunday School will be remembered by many. Only eternity 
        will reveal the impact she had on the lives of the boys and girls in the 
        Primary Department. It is recalled how each child received a pair of hand 
        knitted mitts for Christmas along with an orange and a bag of candy!</p>
      <p>Among the weddings performed by Pastor Harber was the marriage of Susie 
        Bell to William Cavey. Mr. Bell was the church organist for many years.</p>
      <p>Those who had the privilege of sitting under the ministry of this godly 
        man, have many cherished memories of those early days.</p>
