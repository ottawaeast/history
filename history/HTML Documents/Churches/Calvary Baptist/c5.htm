    <td>The Church has one or two under consideration although they have not yet 
      visited Ottawa. Your coming under this arrangement would not preclude your 
      being considered if you liked the Church and the Church was desirous of 
      extending a call. <br>
      The letter is signed by F. C . Blair. 
      <p>For years I had heard of Calvary Baptist Church, its missionary givings, 
        some of its prestigious members, the long and effective pastorate of Rev. 
        James Hall, and now the termination of the pastorate of no less a man 
        than the Rev. E. E. Shields, brother of the world famous Dr. T.T. Shields 
        .</p>
      <p>I accepted the invitation and was thrilled at the prospect of working 
        with such a Church.</p>
      <p><b>THE CALL </b><br>
        Two very worthy men did preach with a view to a call, but at the end of 
        a little over two months as interim Pastor, another letter from the highly 
        respected and much loved F.C. Blair said - &quot;Calvary Baptist Church 
        has voted tonight to extend to you a call to become its Pastor.....if 
        you decide to accept this call I trust you will be blessed in your ministry 
        to a needy and appreciative Church.&quot;</p>
      <p>And so began, not three months, but three unforgettable years as Pastor 
        to some of the most loveable people in the world.</p>
      <p><b>THE RECEPTION</b><br>
        A newspaper clipping here tells of the largely attended reception for 
        my wife and myself held in the church hall. The news item says '.'The 
        guests were received by Rev. and Mrs. Wellington, Mr. A.M. Thomson, Chairman 
        of the Deacons' Board, and Mrs. Thomson.&quot; A host of other familiar 
        names are included in the article - E.M. Zavitz, as chairman for the evening, 
        W.H. Cavey, Church Treasurer, little Frances Fraser who presented Mrs. 
        Wellington with a bouquet of bronze chrysanthemums, Mrs. A.P. Abolit, 
        convenor of refreshments, Mrs. R. Harmer and Mrs. C. James who assisted.</p>
