    <td><b>FUNERALS</b><br>
      Looking over my Ottawa funeral records I am reminded that the first funeral 
      I conducted in Ottawa was that of Walter Hill, In that one I was assisted 
      by Rev. Andrew Telford, of the Metropolitan Bible Church (at that time called 
      &quot;Tabernacle&quot;. Long time members and friends of Calvary will recognize 
      some others that I laid to rest, such as - George Scott, Jane Smith, James 
      Pollock, Dennis Hayes (who professed to receive Christ before he died), 
      Margaret Ann Pearson, Flora Harris (of West Templeton, Quebec) , Alexander 
      Rotar, Annie Arthurs, Sarah Jane Wadsworth, Elizabeth Milne. <br><br>
      <b>WEDDINGS</b><br>
      Amongst the many weddings I performed there are six that some will readily 
      recall - Jane Lester, the daughter of our organist, Durward Lester, who 
      became Mrs. Lee Faris; our choir leader and deacon, Harold, Jackson, to 
      Miss Florence Mulligan; Alma Morrison who became Mrs. Perley Keyes; and 
      Jessie Morrison who became Mrs. Gladwyn Schryer; the two Clark sisters ,Vivian, 
      who became Mrs. Leonard Patterson ,and Grace who became Mrs. William Patterson.
      <p><b>RADIO PROGRAM</b><br>
        Some letters of warm appreciation are reminding me of the quarter hour 
        weekly radio series we had the privilege of inaugurating and conducting 
        for some time in the name of Calvary Baptist Church. This apparently aroused 
        widespread interest. Many claimed it a source of blessing.</p>
      <p><b>SUNDAY SCHOOL</b><br>
        In those years, under the Superintendency of F.C. Blair, with Miss Mary 
        McCracken as Primary Superintendent, and Mr. Carmel James as Treasurer 
        (some of the most faithful people in the world), Calvary Baptist Church 
        had the largest Sunday School in Ottawa with regular attendance ranging 
        between two and three hundred.</p>
      <p>The Gospel story has different effects on different people. Two of the 
        Styran girls were in Mrs. Wellington's class. One eventually became a 
        self-sacrificing missionary (Patricia) spreading the name of Christ amongst 
        the heathen, - the other became Betty Kennedy of radio and television 
        fame. I shall never forget the prayers of their grandmother, Mrs. <br>
        McPhee, for those girls.</p>
