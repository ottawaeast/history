    <td>The Churches 1943 report presented by our faithful Treasurer, Mr. William 
      Cavey, just before Mrs. Wellington and I left for other fields, was most 
      heartening as it indicated a total increase in church receipts of $1,600.00 
      over the previous year. In those days that was a large increase. The people 
      of Calvary Baptist Church were definitely to be congratulated on their wonderful 
      response to both local and world-wide needs, revealing increasing love and 
      loyalty to the Saviour - the Head of the Church . <br><br>
      <b>REFLECTION</b><br>
      We loved Ottawa and we loved the people of Calvary Baptist Church. God had 
      called us to this church and now He was calling us to wider fields, and 
      we were so pleased when we learned that the Church, following our recommendation, 
      had called our good friend, Rev. John Dempster, to be the next Pastor. We 
      knew the church would be in good hands, and under His Hand. &quot;
      <p>We are grateful to Rev. Dr. Wellington for the above resume of his years 
        at Calvary Baptist Church. After leaving Calvary Baptist Church his ministry 
        was more towards the youth and his evangelical crusades in Canada and 
        the United States, geared to winning the youth, are well known.</p>
      <p>Rev. John Dempster came to Calvary in 1943 with his charming wife Anne 
        and two young children - Eva and Jimmy. (Jim is now a husky policeman 
        in Montreal).</p>
      <p>The Dempsters, were very popular and well loved. Our church prospered 
        under their ministry, which was very effective in winning many souls to 
        the Lord, and added to our membership. Those who were teenagers during 
        Pastor Dempster's ministry will recall his keen interest in them. He jealously 
        guarded over them and encouraged them in their Christian walk. Weekly 
        young peoples meetings were held and the importance of Christian Fellowship 
        was stressed and many activities were held in the parsonage and also in 
        other homes, particularly the home of the Smith family - May, Emma and 
        Lou .</p>
      <p>Pastor Dempster introduced Muskoka Baptist Conference to the congregation 
        and one summer a group of some 20 went from Calvary to spend their holidays 
        at the Conference.</p>
      <p>It was during this Pastor's ministry that Miss Patricia Styran answered 
        the call of God for full time service and enrolled in London Bible Institute, 
        London, Ontario.</p>
