    <td><b>4. FRENCH BAPTIST CHURCH</b> - Some mission work was done in 189O, 
      but the present-.church, on King Edward had its commencement in 1901 when 
      Rev. G.R. MacFaul re-opened the work. The church was organized in 1904 with 
      twenty-four members and the building was dedicated the same year. The present 
      church building was erected in 192O. <br>
      <br>
      <b>5. HULL FRENCH BAPTIST CHURCH - </b>Mission work commenced in 1905 and 
      was organized as a church on May 25, 19].6. The building was renovated as 
      a church and opened in 1920. 
      <p>The <b>OTTAWA BAPTIST CHURCH BOARD</b>, consisting of the five aforementioned 
        churches, assisted in Sunday School and Mission preaching work and helped 
        to organize and raise funds for the erection of buildings for many Ottawa 
        Baptist Churches, including our own Calvary Baptist Church, Highland Park, 
        Parkdale and Eastview Baptist Churches. While these works were missions, 
        the Board engaged and paid the pastors but as they organized as churches 
        they took over the conduct of their own work in each case. Building funds 
        for each of the four above churches were raised by the Ottawa Baptist 
        Churches Board by soliciting donations from the Baptist constituency of 
        Ottawa and by contributions from the churches as well.</p>
      <p>The Board was organized in 1907 and tribute is paid to those early members, 
        now deceased for many years, whose vision, dedication, energy and perseverance, 
        working on behalf of the churches which they represented, have achieved 
        truly remarkable results. Among those no longer with us, the following 
        must be mentioned - Alfred Ardley, Louis Blais, O.H. Cog swell, .J.A. 
        Fraser, E.C. Hayes, J.E. Lewitt, J.A. (Fred) McDonald, John Meldrum, Haldane 
        Millar, J.V. Poaps, J.H. Pushman, W.R. Stroud; and C.E. Vail, and others 
        that do not come to mind.</p>
      <p><b>OTTAWA EAST BAPTIST MISSION </b></p>
      <p>The early beginnings of a Baptist work in Ottawa East was in 1903 when 
        work began in a tent on a lot at the corner of Main and Hawthorne, later 
        called Ballantyne Park. In September of the same year a community mission 
        was begun across the street in the Town Hall on the Northeast corner of 
        Main and Hawthorne. Out of this effort the Ottawa East Baptist Mission 
        was formed. Mr. W.E. Beaton, was closely connected with the founding of 
        both Missions as was Mr. F.C. Blair and Mr. John Meldrum.</p>
