    <td>Hundreds of Zulu people found the Lord in those Durban hospitals during 
      the years she spent in regular visitation. In May, 1974, she retired and 
      moved to Green Pastures Rest <br>
      Home, Durbanville, S.A. Even though retired, she continued to witness to 
      the unsaved staff and conducted morning staff prayers. On April 3, 1979, 
      our beloved sister was called <br>
      home to be with the Lord. Acting on her request, she was buried in the land 
      and among the people she loved. <br><br>

        she was accepted by the S.I.M. for <br>
        service in Africa. Pat served in Jos, Nigeria for 2 years but ill health 
        forced her to return to Canada. Pat was burdened for the people that she 
        had grown to love, however after several trips back to the field, she 
        was forced to return home because of continuing poor health. During these 
        years Pat went into nurses training and graduated with a B.Sc. in Nursing, 
        a field in which she has been greatly used, not only here but also in 
        Africa. Pat is presently on staff of the Ottawa University Faculty of 
        Nursing, (Ontario), while working on her Masters, and is actively involved 
        in the church work.</p>
