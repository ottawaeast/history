    <td><b>Rev. Donald F. Howard </b><br>
      Our seventh Pastor, Rev. Don Howard, arrived on the scene on Wednesday August 
      1, 1973. Mr. Howard, his wife Dawn and their two children Carolyn and Colleen 
      commenced their ministry among us. Their son, David, didn't arrive until 
      December of 1977!
      <p>During these seven years several areas of development have been seen. 
        In 1974 a bus was purchased to develop a bus ministry which has serviced 
        the Overbrook and Mann Avenue areas for Bible School and Morning Service. 
        We have rejoiced to see several come to know Jesus Christ as personal 
        Saviour through this outreach.</p>
      <p>The growth of an inner-city church is dependent to a large extent on 
        its outreach in the community. In the Fall of 1973, &quot;Operation Outreach&quot; 
        was initiated. This, the first of several door-to-door visitation ventures, 
        was a systematic visit to each home in the area surrounding the church. 
        Over 3,000 homes were visited. Our present program, &quot;Operation Saturation&quot; 
        is reaching into the Glebe.</p>
      <p>The first Sunday in February 1975 we said &quot;Hello&quot; to several 
        thousand people as we welcomed them to the CALVARY BROADCAST. This 30 
        minute program Sunday mornings over CKBY FM have been a source of encouragement 
        to those who tune in. Letters from listeners far and near share with us 
        the appreciation for this ministry. In 1978, this outreach was expanded 
        to include station CFMK FM, Kingston.</p>
      <p>Marriages performed by Pastor Howard during this time included Mr. And 
        Mrs. Wayne Pappe (nee Valerie Moyer), Mr. and Mrs. Gerry Sauve (nee Jill 
        Feren), Mr. and Mrs. Jim Trotman (nee Pam Harris) and Mr. and Mrs. Nathan 
        Harris (nee Mary Faye Dent).</p>
      <p>Mr. Carmel James, Mr. Oscar Richer, Miss Ethel Matheson, and Miss Mildred 
        Hall, were among the saints promoted to higher service.</p>
      <p>With the desire to see a young man train for the pastorate, Calvary took 
        on Mr. Lorne Trudgian as an intern. This program or' internship has included 
        the exposure to every phase of the ministry in order to equip him for 
        a full-time pastoral work in the future.</p>
      <p>Lorne and Cindy have endeared themselves to our hearts during this year 
        and a half internship.</p>
