    <td>Arthur Cavey, who has become an outstanding missionary Leader to South 
      America, was a young teenager in Calvary Sunday School at that time . <br>
      According to another newspaper clipping I have here, Mr. Blair reported 
      in 1941 after we had completed our first year at Calvary, that, though the 
      Sunday School attendance <br>
      had dropped slightly because of enlistments, the congregation had increased 
      noticeably.
      <p><br>
        <b>REMEMBERING THE PEOPLE</b><br>
        Deacon John Fraser stands out in my memory as one of my richest sources 
        of encouragement in those days. Amongst other names, not already mentioned, 
        that warm my heart as they readily come to mind are - Mrs. Page and Ella, 
        Marjory Frost, Mrs. McCracken, Mrs. Wells and Macaila, Mrs. McKearns , 
        Mrs. Joad, Miss Lightbody, Mrs. Carson, the Rourkes, the Smith girls, 
        Reg Harmer and the lovely Morrison girl he 
        married, the Thompsons, Miss Pitkethly, the Morrison family, the Dale 
        family, the entire Harmer family, the James family, all the Frasers, the 
        Abolits, Jacksons, the Lesters, the Mulligans, Mr.Wright, the Hills, the 
        Griersons, Mrs. Tomlinson, the Wadsworths, the Milnes, the Pattersons, 
        who had the bakery, Mrs. Scott, the Rotars, the Walkers, from Hull, the 
        Pococks, and I know there are more that would come to mind when I quietly 
        reminisce in days to come.</p>
      <p><br>
        <b>BAPTISMS</b><br>
        Amongst those baptized at Calvary, and have gone on beautifully with the 
        lord ever since are Marion Fraser (now Mrs. Joffre Feren), Grace Harmer 
        (now Mrs. Howard Harris) and Reginald Carson, brother of Rev. Thomas Carson.</p>
      <p><b>FINANCES</b><br>
        Finances are very often a barometer indicating spiritual conditions.</p>
      <p>The 1940 Annual Report of the Union of Regular Baptist Churches indicates 
        that Calvary Baptist Church had slipped to fourth largest missionary contributor) 
        after being second only to the great Jarvis Street Baptist Church for 
        years. However, the 1941 Report raised our spirits considerably when it 
        showed Calvary Baptist in third place. Then everything was back to normal 
        again in 1942 when the Report indicated that Calvary Baptist had risen 
        to its accustomed prestigious second place. Out of 70 churches in Ontario 
        and Quebec, it was once again second only to the giant church of the entire 
        Union.</p>
