    <td>Rev. James Hall - In 192]. , Rev. James Hall began a fruitful ministry 
      that lasted some 16 years. Many souls were converted under his ministry. 
      Faithfully, Rev. Hall gave the Church the best years of his life and resigned 
      when ill health made it impossible for him to continue his pastoral duties. 
      <br><br>
      The first marriage performed by Rev. Hall was that of August (Gus) Abolit 
      and Maud (Sis) Hyde on June 13, 1922. Mrs. Abolit is a charter member who 
      still faithfully attends every service and is loved by all. Mr. Abolit was 
      called home on April 30, 1972, just six weeks before their 50th Wedding 
      Anniversary.
      <p>It was during the early part of Rev. Hall's ministry that the Church 
        withdrew from the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec and united 
        with other protesting churches to form the Union of Regular Baptist churches 
        of Ontario and Quebec .This was a protest against the rise of Modernism 
        within the Convention--especially as centered in McMaster University.</p>
      <p>Rev. E. E. Shields, followed Rev. James Hall in 1938. .As a point of 
        interest, it is mentioned that Rev. E. E. Shields was the brother of the 
        renowned world famous Dr. T.T. Shields, <br>
        founder of Jarvis St. Baptist Church, Toronto. Pastor Shields ministered 
        effectively for a short period of two years. Open-air services were held 
        each Sunday afternoon in Ballantyne Park during his time. Pastor Shields 
        relinquished his duties in 1940 because of failing health.</p>
      <p>In 1940 Rev. Frank Wellington, and his very capable wife Joyce, commenced 
        their ministry. A resume of Pastor Wellington ' s term of office is best 
        summed up in his own words that follow verbatim.</p>
      <p><b>REMINISCENCES BY THE PASTOR - 1940~43</b><br>
        By - Rev. Dr. Frank Wellington</p>
      <p>Looking over my Ottawa files, with letters, reports and clippings some 
        40 years old, I have been filled with a sense of nostalgia very rarely 
        experienced.</p>
      <p><b>THE INVITATION</b></p>
      <p>Here is a letter from the Director of Immigration for the Dominion of 
        Canada, dated June 4, 1940. He was also Clerk of Calvary Baptist Church, 
        Ottawa. Part of the letter reads - &quot;At a meeting of the Pulpit Committee 
        on Sunday last, I was asked to write to inquire whether you would be free 
        to come to Ottawa to preach for two or three months beginning immediately, 
        not, howerver, preaching for a call but rather taking over the work for 
        the summer months.</p>
