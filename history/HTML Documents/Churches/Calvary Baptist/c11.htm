    <td>While we may rejoice in the wonderful accomplishment made in erecting 
      a new parsonage and remodeling our church building, by the grace of God 
      and the generous gifts of His people, our main task is the building up of 
      that spiritual house. The material is only a medium of the spiritual--a 
      means to an end. <br><br>
      During the past years many have come to know the Saviour and follow Him 
      through the waters of baptism. With our greatly improved facilities it is 
      our challenge to carryon that blessed ministry in a day when, &quot;evil 
      men and seducers shall wax worse and worse&quot;. With greater measure we 
      must press on with our greater opportunity by: 
      <p>1 -Preaching the old-time Gospel which is still, &quot;the power of God 
        unto salvation to everyone that believeth&quot; ;</p>
      <p>2 -Praying down the blessing and power of the Holy Spirit without whom 
        all our effort will be in vain;</p>
      <p>3 -Persevering in, &quot;earnestly contend (ing) for the faith, which 
        was once for all delivered unto the saints&quot;.</p>
      <p>Let us march on to greater victory as a Spirit-filled church, &quot;fair 
        as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners&quot;<br>
        (Signed John F. Dempster)</p>
      <p>In 1949, one Sunday morning, Pastor Dempster requested the congregation 
        to remain seated after his message and to the great surprise and disappointment 
        of many, read out his resignation. The Lord had called him to work with 
        the &quot;Mission to Lepers&quot;, a post which he held for many years, 
        until the Lord called him back into the pastorate ministry.</p>
      <p><br>
        <b>Rev. David George Olley</b></p>
      <p>In December 1950, Mr. 011ey preached his first sermon as pastor of Calvary 
        Baptist Church. The Church had been without a pastor for over a year. 
        Mr. 011ey was from Newtonards, Northern Ireland and emigrated to Canada 
        with his wife, Ethel and two daughters, Winifred and Evangeline. It was 
        Mr. Olley's intention to conduct evangelistic meetings throughout Canada 
        and the United States. However, after preaching for a call to become our 
        pastor, the Lord led him to accept the call, thus becoming the Church's 
        sixth pastor. Thus began the ministry of a mighty man of God, with great 
        dignity in the pulpit and with a brand of preaching reminiscent of the 
        great preachers of bygone days. It would take a book in itself to adequately 
        describe the impact and blessing that the ministry of such a man had on 
        the lives of those who sat under his preaching over such a lengthy period 
        of time. There are some in the congregation at this present time who were 
        saved under his ministry and there are those who are now in full time 
        service. To name some - Dr. Roy Matheson, Rev. David Irwin, Rev. Howard 
        Hicks, Ronald Scharfe, Patricia Irwin, Ora Moss (now Mrs. Weber). <br>
        <br>
        Some who married Pastors - Maureen Carson (Mrs. Bill Foster) , Maureen 
        Fraser (Mrs. Earl Clemens), Phyllis Scharfe (Mrs. Bill Adams), Eleanor 
        Irwin (Mrs. George McCullagh), Evangeline Olley (Mrs. Ronald Scharfe), 
        Mary Boone (Mrs. Milton Carr).</p>
      <p>It was during Mr. Olley's term as pastor that the church unanimously 
        voted to join &quot;The Fellowship of Evangelical Baptist Churches of 
        Canada&quot;.</p>
      <p>The construction of the &quot;Blair Memorial Hall&quot; was undertaken 
        during Pastor Olley's ministry and is described more fully under &quot;building 
        projects&quot; .</p>
      <p>On October 13, 1961, the congregation was shocked and saddened by the 
        sudden home going of Mr. Olley's beloved wife, Ethel. This was a very 
        difficult time for the Pastor and his two daughters but the Lord undertook 
        and supplied the grace necessary to carryon. Pastor 01ley's ministry was 
        enriched through this trial. After some time, the Lord brought Miss Joyce 
        Kerr into his life and on May 8, 1965 they were married.</p>
      <p>In October 1972, after 22 years of service in Calvary Baptist, Pastor 
        Olley terminated his ministry.</p>
