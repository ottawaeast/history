    <td>led him to accept the call, thus becoming the Church's sixth pastor. Thus 
      began the ministry of a mighty man of God, with great dignity in the pulpit 
      and with a brand of preaching <br>
      reminiscent of the great preachers of bygone days. It would take a book 
      in itself to adequately describe the impact and blessing that the ministry 
      of such a man had on the lives of those who sat under his preaching over 
      such a lengthy period of time. There are some in the congregation at this 
      present time who were saved under his ministry and there are those <br>
      who are now in full time service. To name some - Dr. Roy Matheson, Rev. 
      David Irwin, Rev. Howard Hicks, Ronald Scharfe, Patricia Irwin, Ora Moss 
      (now Mrs. Weber). 
      <p>Some who married Pastors - Maureen Carson (Mrs. Bill Foster) , Maureen 
        Fraser (Mrs. Earl Clemens), Phyllis Scharfe (Mrs. Bill Adams), Eleanor 
        Irwin (Mrs. George McCullagh), Evangeline Olley (Mrs. Ronald Scharfe), 
        Mary Boone (Mrs. Milton Carr).</p>
      <p>It was during Mr. Olley's term as pastor that the church unanimously 
        voted to join &quot;The Fellowship of Evangelical Baptist Churches of 
        Canada&quot;.</p>
      <p>The construction of the &quot;Blair Memorial Hall&quot; was undertaken 
        during Pastor Olley's ministry and is described more fully under &quot;building 
        projects&quot; .</p>
      <p>On October 13, 1961, the congregation was shocked and saddened by the 
        sudden home going of Mr. Olley's beloved wife, Ethel. This was a very 
        difficult time for the Pastor and his two daughters but the Lord undertook 
        and supplied the grace necessary to carryon. Pastor 01ley's ministry was 
        enriched through this trial. After some time, the Lord brought<br>
        Miss Joyce Kerr into his life and on May 8, 1965 they were married.</p>
      <p>In October 1972, after 22 years of service in Calvary Baptist, Pastor 
        Olley terminated his ministry.</p>
