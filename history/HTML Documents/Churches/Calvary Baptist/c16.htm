    <td>Wilfred and Edna Wellington - Wilfred was one of the early pioneer missionaries 
      in Northern Ontario and Quebec, in shanty visitation and establishing churches. 
      Pastor Wellington was the founder of the Montclair Baptist Church in Hull, 
      where he pastored for many years. He later pastored in Seven Islands and 
      Montreal and later in Kapuskasing, Ont. Presently the Wellingtons are in 
      pioneer work in Northern France near the German border. Wilfred and Edna 
      are untiring servants of God with a great zeal to win souls for Christ. 
      <p>David and Marilyn Clark - A burden for foreign service came to the Clarks 
        during a time when David was pastoring a church! Answering God's call, 
        they applied to Baptist Mid-Missions and were accepted for service in 
        Australia. After deputation work, raising travel expenses and support, 
        the Clarks left for Australia. David is actively engaged in a teaching 
        ministry in Victoria Baptist College. Together they are helping to establish 
        indigenous churches throughout Australia. The Clarks have two children 
        - David <br>
        John &quot;DJ&quot; and Chrisa Anne.</p>
      <p>Einar and Donalda Fossum - Einar was born and brought up in Norway and 
        responded to the Lord's invitation to give his life to Him after his training 
        in agriculture college. In 1948, the Lord directed him to Bible Training 
        Institute in Glasgow, Scotland, (D.L. Moody was instrumental in the founding 
        of this institute) where he also learned English.<br><br>
        At the same time, the Lord invited Donalda to give her life to Him, then 
        led her to Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, in 1947. . Unknown to one 
        another, the Lord led them to apply to the S.A.G.M. (now A.E.F.) to serve 
        Him in Northern Rhodesia (name changed to Zambia ,in 1964) to school work, 
        at the same station. They were married in 1954. They have two children, 
        Trevor and Brenda. Einar and Donalda are now involved with Church Planting, 
        working with the Evangelical Church in Zambia in a Leadership Training 
        Program at the Bible College of Central Africa at Ndola.</p>
