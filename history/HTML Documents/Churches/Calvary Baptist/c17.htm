    <td>George and Eleanor Mccullagh - Eleanor (Irwin) answered God's call to 
      full time service while a teenager in Calvary. The Lord led her to London 
      Bible Institute and it was there that she met George, who also had dedicated 
      his life to full time service. They were married in 1967 in Calvary. After 
      graduating from LBI they moved to Indiana where George attended Grace Theological 
      Seminary, Winona Lake, graduating in 1971. George pastored at Hope Baptist 
      Church, London, Ont., and Mount Forest Baptist, Church, Mount Forest, Ontario. 
      In 1978 they were accepted as missionary-appointees with A.B.W.E. and are 
      presently doing deputation work. The McCul1aglls will be involved in medical 
      evangelism, church planting, and teaching, in the Amazon Baptist Hospital, 
      Brazil. George and Eleanor have two children - Stephen and Mark. <br><br>
      <b>BUILDING PROJECTS</b><br>
      The building and renovating projects of Calvary Baptist Church, since its 
      commencement in 1915, have been many and varied. As stated earlier in this 
      booklet, the present lot was purchased in 1908 by the Ottawa Baptist Churches 
      Board and the present building was erected in 1910 and used as a mission 
      until 1915, known as the Ottawa East Baptist Mission. 
      <p>The original building's axis was east and \vest with the pulpit and the 
        baptistry on the east. The entrance on the west was central with a walkway 
        from Main Street. In the early years, renovations were made changing the 
        axis of the church to north and south, as it is today. The pulpit, bapistry 
        and choir loft was on one level with the organ lowered and situated just 
        behind the pulpit area. During these renovations, the entrance was changed 
        to the north-west corner with walkways from Main and Evelyn Avenue.<br>
        <br>
        The next major alterations were undertaken during the ministry of Pastor 
        Dempster, totaling $32,000. In January 1942, a bequest from Mrs. D. McLean 
        formed the nucleus of a Building Fund. Plans were drawn up for the remodeling 
        of the building. At the morning service on the first Sunday of the New 
        Year, 1944, the Pastor preached a special sermon with a view to stimulating 
        this project. New interest was aroused and during the following four years 
        the building fund grew by over $10,000. After some delay in obtaining 
        a contractor, the Alex I. Garvock Construction Co., undertook the project 
        and work began just before Christmas 1946. Work was completed in the spring 
        of 1948 which entailed the lowering of the basement, kitchen and washroom 
        facilities improved, new ceiling installed in the main auditorium, restructure 
        of the pulpit and choir area, raising the baptistry and a new entrance, 
        installation of oak pews. The pulpit, pews and choir-front all in oak, 
        were purchased from the Globe Furnishing Co., Waterloo, Ontario. These 
        greatly enhanced the beauty of the main auditorium. The background picture 
        in the baptistry was painted by Mr. Nelson Trafford, one of the young 
        people of the church.</p>
