    <td>Calvary Baptist Church, from its inception, has been in the forefront 
      in its endeavour to spread the Work of God to the four corners of the world. 
      To list all those who went into full time service from the church or who 
      have been assisted financially by the church, is a monumental task, and 
      inadvertently some will be missed. However, starting in the early pioneer 
      days and working down to the present, the following come to mind: - <br>
      Rev. T.E. McAl1ister; Rev. A.H. Sprole; Rev. M. Saunders (formerly of Elgin 
      St. Baptist Church, Arnprior, Ont.);Rev. W.R. McKay, (formerly Pembroke 
      Baptist Church, Pembroke, Ont.); Rev. Clarence Sawyer (former Director of 
      Youth for Christ, Hamilton, Ont.). 
      <p>Rev. and Mrs. John Hall and Family - Mr. Hall was a brother to the Rev. 
        James Hall, Calvary's pastor from 1921-38. In 1916 Rev. John Hall left 
        Canada enroute to Africa and for many years served the Lord in Central 
        Nigeria, one thousand miles north of Lagos. His ministry was mostly to 
        the Tangale tribe of whom Mr. Hall wrote a book, which can be obtained 
        from the church library, entitled &quot;From Cannibalism to Christ&quot;.</p>
      <p>Rev. and Mrs. Horace Davey - Mr. Davey was ordained in Calvary in 1928. 
        Served in Liberia West Africa from 1928-37 under the Union of Regular 
        Baptist Churches. In 1929 he opened anew station at New Cess among the 
        Bassa tribe, where they rescued an African baby &quot;Danny&quot; from 
        death the day after he was born. From 1938-43, he served under W.E.C. 
        After returning home, Mr. Davey took up the pastorate at Kenmore, N.Y.</p>
      <p>Rev. and Mrs. T.D.M. Carson - Mr. Carson was converted in Calvary. He 
        began. His ministry at &quot;Immanual Baptist Church&quot;, Verdun, Quebec, 
        in 1937 and was ordained in May 1941. In 1943, Mr. Carson resigned to 
        minister as a pioneer in French work at Drummondvil1e, Quebec. At the 
        present time, Tom is the associate pastor at Montclair Baptist Church, 
        Hull, Quebec.</p>
      <p>Miss Inez Botterell - Who could ever forget this dear servant of God 
        who served in South Africa, first under the S.A.G.M. and later renamed 
        A.E.F. Miss Botterell went out to the <br>
        field in 1921 and ministered to the Zulus at Mseleni, Zu1uland. She perfected 
        the very difficult language of the Zulus, which was made up of tones and 
        clicks which were very <br>
        difficult to perfect, and she was used to great success in teaching the 
        language to new missionaries as they arrived on the field. In 1954, at 
        the age of 63, Miss Botterell <br>
        moved permanently to the city of Durban, S.A. and began almost 20 years 
        of active fruitful ministry in hospital visitation.</p>
