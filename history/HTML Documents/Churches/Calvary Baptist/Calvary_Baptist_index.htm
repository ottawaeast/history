    <td>As the Twentieth Century dawned, the Village of Ottawa East was well on 
      its way to becoming a modern suburb nestled between the canal and river 
      adjacent to a thriving city. The 1901 Census (1) indicates that the population 
      of the village was approximately 1,500 souls comprised of a wide variety 
      of ethnic backgrounds and religious affiliations.
      <p>Of the religious denominations, the <a href="../CanMartyrs/CanMartyrs_Page_One.htm">Roman 
        Catholics</a>, Presbyterians, <a href="../Wesley/Wesley%20United%20Church%20Page%20One.htm">Methodists</a> 
        and <a href="../Ascension/Ascension_Page_One.htm">Anglicans</a> were the 
        most dominant in the village followed by the <a href="../../History/Germans/Ottawa_East_Germans.htm">German 
        Lutherans</a> and other small groups. One of the smallest congregations 
        was the Baptist group with only about 25 people identified as such in 
        the census (2). But quantity was not a problem for the Baptists given 
        their evangelical zeal and strong leadership and within a few short years 
        Calvary Baptist Church came into being.</p>
      <p>The early records of the church no longer exist so it is not possible 
        to detail the entire original congregation. Fortunately, the congregation 
        wrote a history of the church in 1948 for the Thirty-third anniversary 
        and revised the document in 1980 for the Sixty-fifth anniversary. Both 
        documents contain a rich amount of information detailing the people and 
        accomplishments of the church from its very beginning as the Ottawa East 
        Baptist Mission in 1903.</p>
      <p>The 1980 anniversary document, revised by Howard and Grace Harris, contains 
        much of the original 1948 work and updates the congregation to near-present 
        day. Additional information regarding the most recent Pastors has been 
        added along with selected scans from the 1948 commemorative booklet. The 
        actual 1980 document was scanned and converted to digital using OCR. Therefore, 
        while every effort has been made to faithfully reproduce the original, 
        there may be small, inconsequential variations regarding the format.</p>
      <p>As well, a <a href="Calvary%20Picture%20Page.htm">Calvary Baptist Picture 
        Page</a> has been included rather than place the pictures in the document.</p>

         </div>
		
      <p>&nbsp;The detailed history of a church cannot be written. It is composed of 
        the innumerable acts of service and sacrifice of its individual members. 
        Only God knows how much of time, effort, prayer and money the men and 
        women of this church, from the day of its origin to this day, have given. 
        He alone knows the full sweep of its ministry upon the lives of individuals, 
        the community and the world at large.</p>
      <p>For a complete history of Calvary Baptist Church, it is necessary to 
        go back many years in retrospect to the beginnings of the Baptist work 
        as a whole in Ottawa.<br>
        In 1907, a Board was formed known as the Ottawa Baptist Churches Board 
        to co-ordinate the local mission work of the existing Churches in Ottawa 
        at that time, being -</p>
      <p>THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH - so called because it was the first church-looking 
        towards the establishment of Baptist work in Ottawa. The first meeting 
        was held on August 7, 1855, with four persons present. Services in the 
        form of prayer meetings were held regularly on Sundays after that date. 
        Preaching services in the Temperance Hall once every four weeks were commenced 
        in 1856 and the following year these services were held every Sunday.</p>
      <p>The first church building known as the Queen Street Baptist Chapel was 
        opened in December 1863. By 1871, the membership was sixty. The First 
        Baptist Church building was opened for services on September 29, 1878, 
        at its present location, on the corner of Elgin and Laurier.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Being the mother church in the city , the First Church gave much in leadership, 
        membership and financial assistance to the other churches which from time 
        to time had been organized in other parts of the city and suburbs, and 
        it is to her credit that these had been given cheerfully, gladly and unreservedly.</p>
      <p>2. MCPHAIL MEMORIAL BAPTIST CHURCH - organized in August, 1886 with a-membership 
        of twenty-four, all of whom came from the First Church. The first place 
        of worship was a Mission hall on Concession Street (now Bronson Ave.). 
        The present <br>
        church building was erected in 1903, and is located on Bronson.</p>
      <p>3. FOURTH AVENUE BAPTIST CHURCH - First services were held in Moreland's 
        Hall in 1898 and the church was organized on March 30, 1899, with thirty-two 
        members, twenty from First Church and ten from McPhail Memorial and two 
        from the Baptist Church in South Gower. The Sunday School Hall was opened 
        for services in 1900, and the main part of the church was dedicated on 
        April 2, 1905. This church is located on the corner of <br>
        Fourth Ave. and Bank Street .</p>
