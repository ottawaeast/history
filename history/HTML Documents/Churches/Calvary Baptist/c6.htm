    <td><b>THE MILITARY PARADE </b><br>
      Another clipping reminds me of the military church parade, and the thrilling 
      challenge of presenting the Gospel to the Protestants of the Ammunition 
      Company 1st Corps Troops from Petawawa under the command of Captain John 
      Bell (later Col. Bell), a member of Calvary Baptist of whom the church was 
      justly proud. The church was jammed beyond capacity that Sunday morning. 
      The seas of faces, the military music, are unforgettable. 
      <p><br>
        <b>OUR BOYS</b><br>
        This brings to mind the boys of the church who enlisted and served overseas. 
        I feel saddened and proud as I picture in my mind's eye Eric Dewar, Kenneth 
        Dale, Wendall Clark and Charlie McKearns who were amongst those who did 
        not return. I cannot forget the solemn earnestness of Kenneth Dale, who, 
        on the eve of his departure, came to me for counseling and special prayer 
        .</p>
      <p><b>SERVICEMEN AT THE SERVICES </b><br>
        Through the years since my pastorate at Calvary many men in many different 
        locations have re-introduced themselves to me and reminded me of their 
        regular attendance at our services when they were stationed in Ottawa 
        in the Army, Navy or Air Force, during those years of the war - 1940- 
        1943.One of them, Rev. Eric Crichton, who at that time was in the Air 
        Force, and is now Pastor of a large church in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 
        wrote me on the occasion of my 30th anniversary in the field of evangelism. 
        In part of his letter he says -&quot;It is such a joy to send greetings 
        to you at this time and to acknowledge with many others on this occasion 
        the evident hand of the Lord upon you in this strategic and significant 
        ministry for our Lord Jesus Christ . We thank God for a great company 
        throughout Canada and the United States who could rise up and cal1 you 
        &quot;blessed&quot; because you were God's instrument in bringing them 
        to saving faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>If I may add a more personal note, I would like to express my gratitude 
        for your ministry years ago at Calvary Baptist Church in Ottawa during 
        the Second World War. It was my privilege to worship with you on numerous 
        occasions and always with blessing to my soul. I can still remember some 
        of the message which you preached in those days. &quot;</p>
