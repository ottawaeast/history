    <td>Some of the weddings that come to mind are Eleanor Fraser to Douglas Draper, 
      Joan Bell to Hugh McNaughton, Irene Morrison to Burpee Palmer, Lois Morrison 
      to Reg Harmer, Winnifred Hill to William Smith. Pastor Dempster led the 
      congregation in an extensive building program which saw .2 complete remodelling 
      of the church building. A more detailed account: of the remodelling will 
      be discussed under &quot;Building Projects&quot;. 
      <p>On April 4, 5, 1948, the Church's 33rd Anniversary and Re-dedication 
        Services were held. A special booklet was prepared at that time and the 
        following message, by the Pastor, was included in it -</p>
      <p><b>THE CHURCH OF GOD </b></p>
      <p>This was a favorite phrase of the Apostle Paul. He wasn't thinking in 
        terms of a material building but of the assembly of born again believers 
        united <br>
        as a witness to the saving grace of God's &quot;only begotten Son&quot;.</p>
      <p>He reminded the idolatrous Athenian that God , &quot;dwelleth not in 
        temples made with hands&quot;. And the Lord Jesus Christ said to the Samaritan 
        woman, &quot;God is a Spirit, and they that worship <br>
        him must worship him in spirit and in truth&quot;.</p>
      <p>Material buildings are an earthly, temporal necessity but the spiritual 
        reality of, 'the church of God', is heavenly and eternal.</p>
      <p>A true church, then, is not that made &quot;with men's hands&quot;, but 
        that spiritual building of which Peter said, &quot;Ye also, as lively 
        stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up 
        spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God by Jesus Christ', and, as Paul 
        said, &quot;are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, 
        Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; In whom all the building 
        fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord; In whom 
        ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit&quot;.</p>
