        PRESENT DAYS </b> </div>
      <p><br>
        In 1990 Arthur Brewer left Ascension (he spent two years at St. Barnabus, 
        after which he retired.) Gary Hauch came from St. Thomas the Apostle on 
        Alta Vista Drive where he had been the assistant curate. An American, 
        Gary was born in Germany, immigrated to the United States as a child and 
        naturalized as an American citizen. He came to Canada in 1977 to study 
        at Regent College (an international graduate school of Christian studies) 
        in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1979 he and his wife Linda moved to 
        Ottawa where Linda began her doctoral studies in Medieval literature. 
        It was at this time that Gary and Linda were drawn to the Anglican Church. 
        Two years later they moved to Princeton, New Jersey, where Gary studied 
        for his doctoral degree. When the Hauchs returned to Ottawa with their 
        two sons in 1985, Gary took the position at St. Thomas while Linda continued 
        her studies and taught at Ottawa University. Gary came to Ascension in 
        August and was inducted as priest on November 30, St. Andrew's Day.<br>
      </p>
      <p>When he came to Ascension, Gary Hauch said he hoped &quot;to help build 
        a community of people who would make a difference in the world,&quot; 
        who would, as serious Christians, &quot;work to break down the prejudice 
        against people of different races, colours, and cultures, would understand 
        themselves to be environmental stewards, and would explore the social 
        implications of the gospels.&quot;</p>
      <p>Ascension has been actively involved with refugees and new Canadians 
        since 1991. In the early '90s this included sending funds to a refugee 
        camp in Tanzania where an Ascension associate was working, and supporting 
        communities from El Salvador and Guatemala. More recently Gary encouraged 
        the parish to sponsor refugees &quot;from countries at war or where repressive 
        regimes threaten lives&quot;. Since then, Ascension has sponsored refugee 
        families from Burundi and, in conjunction with Trinity and All Saints, 
        Sandy Hill, refugee families from Sudan. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In the spring of 1993, Wes Maultsaid, Judy Cray, and six people from 
        two other churches in the diocese (St. George's and All Saints, Westboro) 
        went to Guatemala for two weeks. Judy said, &quot;We went there to learn 
        about the Mayan people, their culture and what it was like living under 
        an oppressive regime&quot;. Each person paid his/her own way but had support 
        with prayer and some financial assistance from their home churches. On 
        their return, those who had made the trip reported to their home churches 
        and, as well, spoke to interested people elsewhere.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Later, that same year, Ascension sponsored parishioner Colin Rowatt to 
        travel in Mexico and Guatemala on &quot;Project Accompaniment&quot;. From 
        September until the following April, Colin was among those who accompanied 
        a group of Guatemalan refugees home from the refugee camp in Mexico where 
        they had been living for some years under the protection of the UN Commission 
        on Human Rights.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In 1999, Tricia Wind and Dwein Hodgson left for Tanzania to work with 
        the Christian Reformed World Relief Committee on community projects and 
        justice education, an organization dedicated to improving conditions in 
        parts of the world where there is considerable poverty and injustice or 
        where disaster has struck. &quot;We worked with farmers to increase their 
        incomes and with widows to help them keep their lands and possessions 
        after their husbands died,&quot; Tricia reported. Dwein and Tricia returned 
        in October, 2002 to settle back into life in Ottawa in time for Tricia 
        to give birth to their first child.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In October 2003, Bill Baldwin, Ascension parishioner and retired priest, 
        went for two weeks to Palestine and Jerusalem with a contingent from Christian 
        churches as part of a multi-national, inter-denominational Christian Peacemaker's 
        team.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Ascension has long been involved with the Ottawa East neighbourhood of 
        churches but, in our time, Haig McCarrell set up weekly &quot;Coffee and 
        Conversation&quot; evenings to welcome and interact with refugees and 
        new Canadians. Those evenings still happen every Wednesday evening, now 
        at 88 Main Street. (The neighbourhood community-kitchen group that meets 
        twice a month in our church kitchen to share cooking is an offshoot of 
        these evenings.) <br>
      </p>
      <p>Like Robert Jefferson and Arthur Caulfield before him, Gary Hauch wanted 
        this parish to be a family. Together with Haig McCarrell, Dwein Hodgson, 
        Mishka Lysack and others, he explored having house groups at Ascension. 
        House groups would be made up of a small number of people with particular 
        aims and interests. <br>
      </p>
      <p>The house group idea wasn't new but it hadn't been tried at Ascension 
        so, at first, it was a short-term project, The Epiphany Project, so named 
        because the first house-group meetings were to take place in the week 
        following the 1996 Epiphany Night celebration at the church. The celebration 
        that year included a performance of Julian, a one-woman play about Julian 
        of Norwich, performed in the church sanctuary by Kathleen McLaughlin, 
        an Ottawa Roman Catholic nun. It was followed by a potluck supper in the 
        hall.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The house-group idea caught on. Some of the original groups are still 
        meeting, some have fallen by the wayside, and others have started up. 
        The Alpha Groups are still going, the once-a-month Monday Night Epiphany 
        Group still gathers to talk, to sing, to share experiences, the music 
        group still meets. In 1997 Gerry Green started a men's club to meet once 
        a week for breakfast and, afterwards, take care of church maintenance. 
        A Bible study group was formed in 2000 and, in 2004, a mothers' and babies 
        group has begun to meet on Thursday mornings for mutual support, conversation 
        and lunch.<br>
        Over the last twelve years, the parish has held one-day retreats in the 
        church and at Gracefield and Temple Pasture in Quebec. As well, The Parish 
        Council has gone on weekend retreats at Temple Pastures and many in the 
        parish have shared weekend retreats at Camp IAWAH, the non-denominational 
        Christian camp on Wolf Lake near Westport. <br>
      </p>
      <p>These retreats have become important to the life of the parish. Not only 
        do they encourage the sense of family that is so important to us, serious 
        decisions have been made on retreat. During a retreat &quot;discernment 
        process&quot; in 1996 members of the parish prayed and discussed what 
        outreach Ascension should focus on. To everyone's surprise, the response, 
        loud and clear, was children. As a result we changed our liturgy to make 
        children more a part of it, and have made every effort to welcome children 
        to our church. There is now a children's story at the beginning of every 
        service. Linda Hauch, with the help of Anneke Jansen van Doorn, headed 
        the effort to enlarge the Sunday school and re-shape the curriculum with 
        the special House-of-the Good-Shepherd program for the nursery-school 
        age. And Ascension is now is a church full of children ranging in age 
        from a few weeks to adolescence. <br>
      </p>
      <p>A new newsletter (&quot;An Occasional Newsletter from the Church of the 
        Ascension&quot;) was started in December of 1990.It fell by the wayside 
        but was started up again in 2002 by Annie MacTavish. Gary has invited 
        artists in the parish to make use of the hall for book launches or art 
        exhibits - Alison Gresick launched her first book of short stories, Brick 
        and Mortar at the church in 2000.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the mid-nineties Gary encouraged the young adults in the parish to 
        organize a series of coffee-house evenings to celebrate causes like social 
        justice, peace and care for the environment (in 2001, Ascension, with 
        All Saints, Westboro And St. John's, Elgin Street, won the first Green 
        Church Award) or simply as get-togethers for the deanery young people. 
        For these evenings the hall was transformed into a colourfully decorated 
        1960's style coffee house with coffee, tea, or soda pop to drink plus 
        all manner of home-made baked goods. A stage was set up from which people 
        read poetry, performed on musical instruments or sang. (The idea has taken 
        hold once more and the first of a new coffee-house series was held on 
        January 18, 2003.)<br>
      </p>
      <p>These evenings only stopped when the parish energy shifted to raising 
        money for an elevator. The chair lift, which everyone in the congregation 
        had hoped would be so wonderful, had turned out to be unworkable. A wheel-chair-bound 
        person had to get out of his/her chair and navigate a couple of steps 
        in order to get in or out of the lift and, sometimes, the lift would tip. 
        In the end only the kids used it (and it beeped loudly and constantly 
        while they did). Maintenance fees still had to be paid even though the 
        lift wasn't being used and the parish council decided to abandon it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>A family is not a family when some of its members can't get into the 
        house so plans were soon being discussed for an elevator. This project 
        turned out to be monumentally expensive. The first architectural drawings, 
        alone, cost $5,000. A committee, made up of Shirley and Reg Callard, Gerry 
        Green and Alf Perinbam explored all possibilities. Their explorations 
        yielded the information that the elevator would cost more than the parish 
        could possibly afford. The parish council discussed asking for money from 
        the Trillium foundation but that money comes from the provincial lottery 
        and vestry voted not to take it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>That's when the miracle happened. Marian Rollinson, a long-time Ascension 
        parishioner died and left the church over $140,000. At first the parish 
        council thought the bequest would buy us the elevator but when it was 
        discovered that only the interest could be spent, the members of council 
        decided to go ahead and spend parish funds. The church would get its elevator. 
        Work started. The old coal cellar-cum-junk-room (always called &quot;the 
        glory hole&quot;) below the stairs leading into the church disappeared, 
        a wall was moved, the side entrance to the church was closed, a new downstairs 
        door with the ramp and the small courtyard appeared in front, the elevator 
        was built and, at last, people who couldn't manage the stairs could get 
        to church. The elevator was up and running by Easter, 1999. For those 
        who could manage the stairs, the old, worn wooden ones gave way to new, 
        more reliable cement ones.<br>
      </p>
      <p>If the parishioners who marched in procession from the old Holy Trinity 
        to lay the cornerstone for their new Church of the Ascension back in September 
        of 1919 could be around today, they would see many other differences in 
        their church. The choir stalls are gone and the sanctuary/worship space 
        has now more room and four communion stations. In the mid nineties, after 
        much discussion and some experimenting with worship space, vestry decided 
        to have the Eucharist celebrated closer to the congregation than the high 
        altar. So a small temporary altar was set up near the chancel steps.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The glass windows at the back of the church have gone. There is a more 
        open feeling to the whole church and there are no military flags. The 
        large baptismal font stands, as it always has, in the narthex, but baptisms 
        are now celebrated in the chancel and the font is a small, hand-made font 
        that Bill and Betty Service gave to the church when the old Anglican Church 
        in Sherbrooke Corners (part of the parish of St. Paul's, Westport) was 
        dismantled. (The Sherbrooke Corners' church was Betty Service's childhood 
        church and was where the Service children were baptized.) <br>
      </p>
      <p>No one in Gary Hauch's church has ever thought of calling him Father 
        or even Mr. Hauch (first names for priest and parishioner alike in this 
        21st century). There is no choir, except at Easter and Christmas. Instead, 
        we have an organist, Beatrix Finta, and the music group, that sings and 
        plays various instruments (including bongo drums). There is no traditional 
        altar guild; volunteers do the work the altar guild once did. And, there 
        is no licensed lay reader. When Arthur Humphries died in 1998, he left 
        the position of lay reader open. Now a group of parishioners share in 
        the reading of the lessons, the psalm, the gospel and the prayers of the 
        people.<br>
      </p>
      <p>We gather often, as a church family, for potluck lunches and suppers 
        and, every year, as well as the traditional pancake supper in the hall 
        on Shrove Tuesday, Ascension has a Seder supper on Maundy Thursday to 
        remind us of our Old- Testament roots and of the Passover supper Jesus 
        shared with his disciples. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In the spring of 1990, the year he came to Ascension, Gary wrote in the 
        newsletter that the parish of Ascension is &quot;a remarkably diverse 
        community that is serious about living its faith in the world... a grateful 
        response to God's gift in Christ.&quot; His words surely express what 
        so many of Ascension's priests and congregations have felt over all these 
        years.<br>
      </p>
      <p>May we continue to be so blessed.<br>
