        <b>CHURCH OF THE ASCENSION </b></div>
      <p>In 1916, Bishop Roper appointed Robert Jefferson to take over from Mark 
        Malbert. Mr. Jefferson came to Holy Trinity from Franktown and Montague 
        and was inducted on December 24th of that year. The bishop described him 
        as a &quot;young, energetic Irishman&quot; and Wilfred Bradley (in his 
        book The Life and Times of John Charles Roper) called him, &quot;a canny, 
        warmhearted Ulsterman,&quot; with, &quot;the mind of a Scot and the heart 
        of an Irishman&quot;. His coming, after the dithering of an aging, querulous 
        Frederick Squires, was welcomed with enthusiasm. He conducted three Sunday 
        services: 8:00 a.m. communion, 11:00 a.m. morning prayer and 7:00 p.m. 
        evening prayer with church school, young men's and young women's Bible 
        classes in the afternoon. He led a weekly Bible Study on Wednesday evenings. 
        Baptisms were held on the first Sunday of the month and by appointment.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Robert Jefferson had a lot of innovative ideas, and he brought about 
        what one admirer called &quot;remarkable growth&quot; in the parish. Clubs 
        and organizations proliferated under his guidance. While he continually 
        despaired of the choir (in the 1920s he was still complaining about the 
        fact that Ascension was the &quot;only church in the city&quot; without 
        a choirmaster), Sunday school flourished, the Babies Branch of the Women's 
        Auxiliary regularly had between twenty and thirty members (at a yearly 
        fee of seventy-five cents). There was again a branch of The Brotherhood 
        of St. Andrew and the members of the Men's Club played billiards and carpet 
        ball in tournaments with men's clubs from other churches. Mr. Jefferson, 
        because he wanted his parishioners to feel like a family, promoted frequent 
        picnics and, because he was a great proponent of outdoor sports, saw to 
        it that there was a church tennis club. After the move to the new church, 
        he oversaw the building of a tennis court next to the church.<br>
        <br>
        Patriotism was running high in these war years. After Canadian soldiers 
        in France had captured Vimy Ridge and Courcellette from the Germans in 
        1917, Robert Borden's Conservatives won the federal election on a vote 
        for conscription. Patriotic songs were sung everywhere. War-bond drives 
        increased in number and fervour. In churches there were more and longer 
        prayer vigils. Bishop Roper declared diocesan-wide days of prayer. When 
        the department of health closed all public buildings during the 1918-19 
        influenza epidemic that killed so many people, the bishop was reluctant 
        to decree that the churches were to comply, but, finally, he had to. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Despite the continuing worry about the war and the flu epidemic, there 
        was a feeling of buoyancy at Holy Trinity. The congregation had been steadily 
        growing, the financial situation had improved and the parish decided it 
        needed a bigger church. A building committee was struck, plans were underway 
        and Captain Andrew Acres, the parish treasurer, began organizing campaigns 
        to raise money. Campaigners canvassed the parishioners and all their friends 
        and relations. The Men's Club had dinners, the choir and the Dramatic 
        Society put on plays, the Ladies' Guild had suppers, bazaars and rummage 
        sales. For several years, that guild operated a booth at the Exhibition 
        where they sold cakes, bread, jams, pickles and crafts.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The war was over in November of 1918. The church was open for prayers 
        of thanksgiving on that day. The armistice was signed on November 11th 
        at 11:00 o'clock - and that day, Armistice Day, (now called Remembrance 
        Day) was declared a national holiday for all the years to come. The Winter 
        family gave the church the pulpit in thanks for the safe return of their 
        son and daughter. The Guy family contributed to the purchase of the prayer 
        desks in thanks for their son's safe return; the Boscall family contributed 
        to the prayer desks in memory of a husband and father who were killed.<br>
      </p>
      <p>By the following summer, the Holy Trinity congregation had amassed enough 
        money to buy &quot;three lots south of the Ottawa East bridge&quot; (at 
        a cost of $4,000). Amid the relief and the prayers of thankfulness, Archdeacon 
        Arthur Mackay turned the first sod for the new church in June of 1919. 
        (Mr. Mackay had been Holy Trinity's priest back when it had been under 
        the care of St. John's.) <br>
      </p>
      <p>Then, on Saturday, the 27th of September, the bishop, the rector, the 
        wardens, visiting clergy and the congregation formed behind a &quot;colourful&quot; 
        banner anchored between two &quot;ornate staves&quot; and solemnly processed 
        to the new site. Bishop Roper gave a speech in what Ted Gunderson described 
        as his &quot;pure, deep baritone voice&quot; and laid the cornerstone 
        for the new church. Mr. Gunderson never forgot it (one reason being that 
        it was his 21st birthday).<br>
      </p>
      <p>According to Charles Winter (by then Colonel Winter) who wrote the church's 
        1944 commemorative pamphlet, the old church was &quot;advantageously disposed 
        of by sale&quot;. (There are records and letters to say that attempts 
        were made to sell it in 1925, but there doesn't seem to be a record of 
        an actual sale until 1977 when it was sold to the Portugese Community 
        Association which still owns it.) <br>
      </p>
      <p>The new church, to be called The Church of the Ascension, was dedicated 
        on the feast of the Annunciation, Maundy Thursday, March 25, 1920. The 
        name change was at Bishop Roper's recommendation. The diocese of Ottawa 
        already had Trinity Church on Bank Street in Ottawa South, which was older 
        than Holy Trinity (by a year), and he wanted to avoid confusion. The total 
        cost of the new church, according to Colonel Winter, was $23,000. Insurance 
        for it was so hard to get that quite a few members of the Advisory Board 
        (later the parish council) took out one- thousand-dollar life-insurance 
        policies, naming the church as beneficiary.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The church bell (the old train-engine bell) was moved from the old to 
        the new building, as were the organ, the lectern, the pews, other minor 
        furnishings and the memorial windows. While much of the church's interior 
        was still rough, Mr. Jefferson and his congregation began at once to worship 
        in it.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In 1923, the parish council decided to buy the two lots next to the church 
        for a rectory and a new parish hall and, for the time being, took out 
        a three-year lease on 223 Echo Drive (at the corner of Hawthorne and Echo), 
        the rector's then residence. In the meanwhile, work on the existing parish 
        hall and the church interior was being completed. The Men's Club, under 
        the direction of their president G. C. Armstrong, did the actual work 
        themselves and paid for the materials with the proceeds from a play they 
        were putting on. The hall and the sanctuary floor were both finished by 
        Christmas.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In Ascension's first year, the parish started a monthly magazine called 
        The Church of the Ascension Parish Magazine, founded by the Young People's 
        Association and published by the Men's Club. It was an ambitious project, 
        professionally printed and paid for with ads and subscriptions at one 
        dollar a year. It contained a regular rector's letter, plus reports of 
        organization meetings and synopses of vestry meetings. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Not long afterwards, Henry Humphries, active Men's Club member, started 
        a scout troop (the 29th Troop), which was active all through the 1920s. 
        It lapsed in the early '30s, was re-activated later in the decade, but 
        it didn't really flourish again until the 1970s and '80s. <br>
        In May of 1927, when Robert Jefferson left to become the priest at St. 
        Matthew's in the Glebe, there were 235 families in the parish (about 900 
        people) with 250 children in the Sunday school. The parish had its 50th 
        anniversary that year.</p>
