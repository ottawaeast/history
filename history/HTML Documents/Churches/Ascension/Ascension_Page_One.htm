    <td colspan="2"><b>PREAMBLE </b> 
      <p> A church's history is the history of a place of worship. It is also, 
        in a lot of ways, like a family's history, not only a chronicle of dates 
        and events but also a collection of stories that holds its members together 
        and gives it a collective memory. One of the difficulties in putting together 
        this (and probably any other) church history is that it is hard to find 
        the people and their stories behind the dry old account books and minutes 
        of vestry meetings. It isn't any easier to discern the spiritual direction 
        any one priest or generation of parishioners has taken. Only every once 
        in a while is there a brief anecdote, a wry comment, a spurt of anger, 
        of humour or joy, a sign of approval or an unexpected prayer to bring, 
        for a moment, a person or a group sharply into focus.<br>
      </p>
      <p>However, two constants shine through the years of Ascension's records 
        of financial ups and downs and differences of opinion about how the church 
        should be run - from how much to pay for coal to whether or not to continue 
        the service of evensong.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The first is that, from the beginning, our church has welcomed all comers. 
        In a letter asking churchmen in Britain to donate money to the fledgling 
        mission church in 1877, Thomas Phillips, wrote, &quot;There being no other 
        religious service in the village, members of other denominations attend 
        Trinity church, and send their children to the Sunday School.&quot; Mr. 
        Phillips, the church's first priest, had begun an outreach program long 
        before that word had entered the English language. Throughout these one-hundred-and 
        twenty-five years, our church has always welcomed everyone, from Thomas 
        Phillips's shepherding to Gary Hauch's. The second is really only part 
        two of the first. When Robert Jefferson came to be priest at the church 
        in 1916, he said that one of his chief aims was to see that the people 
        in his congregation should know and care for one another. Arthur Caulfield 
        said much the same thing seventeen years later and it has been the unspoken 
        wish of almost every priest who has served at Ascension. It is certainly 
        true today. One of our parishioners said recently that Ascension is the 
        first church in which he has felt he belonged, where he felt truly at 
        home. &quot;When I turn towards the congregation after taking communion,&quot; 
        he said, &quot;I see people I know, people I think of as friends.&quot; 
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>The history of our church is a history of a collection of such friends, 
        of a family.</p>
      <p><b>BEGINNINGS</b><br>
        <br>
        The Church of the Ascension is not the same church in the year 2002 as 
        the church that was &quot;opened for divine service by His Lordship, the 
        Bishop of Ontario, on the first of September, 1877.&quot; Not only was 
        divine service infinitely more formal 125 years ago than it is at Ascension 
        today, the church building was different; it was in a different location, 
        and it had a different name.<br>
      </p>
      <p>This first church was called The Church of the Holy Trinity. It was a 
        mission church of the diocese of Ontario built on the corner of Main Street 
        and Echo Drive (then called Canal Drive) in the village of Archville. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Before this, before there could be a church, a group of Anglican men in 
        the community, including John Lowe (the deputy minister of Agriculture 
        for Canada), ___Bethune, James Webster and Dr. James Fletcher formed a 
        committee and sent Messrs. Lowe and Bethune to the synod in Kingston to 
        apply to have a church. They were granted permission. <br>
      </p>
      <p>With John Lowe acting as treasurer, they raised the money and bought 
        the site for $875.00 from Archibald Stewart after whom the village of 
        Archville had been named. The church, the little red brick building still 
        standing on the corner of Echo and Main, cost $3,088.51 including furnishings 
        - a lot of money considering that you could buy a pretty decent house 
        in Ottawa in 1877 for about $1000, and the collection plate yielded only 
        between seven and eight dollars every Sunday. The congregation, which 
        had formed itself that January, raised some of the money; some was borrowed 
        from the bank. Thomas Phillips, the priest of the new church, collected 
        the rest from his friends.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mr. Phillips must have been a truly dedicated man because, as well as 
        soliciting his own friends, he donated his services to the church for 
        its first three years, and in the summer of 1878, he went to England to 
        plead for money from churchmen there for his &quot;poor but promising 
        mission.&quot; Two years later, he was earning the munificent annual stipend 
        of $206.26. He kept body and soul together as &quot;a mathematical master&quot; 
        at the Ottawa Collegiate Institute (later Lisgar Collegiate) and by tutoring 
        students privately. Mr. Phillips was a popular and surely an energetic 
        man because, in addition to his dedication to his church and his teaching, 
        he was apparently a fine cricket player. (He was still playing cricket 
        in his eighties).<br>
      </p>
      <p>For a few years, Holy Trinity was the only church in the village. In 
        the letter he wrote in England to the British churchmen asking for money, 
        Thomas Phillips told his hoped-for supporters that he conducted divine 
        service both morning and evening four times a month with Sunday School 
        for fifty children in the afternoons. They were not all Anglicans.<br>
        <br>
        The church served people on both sides of the canal. During its first 
        years, the nearest bridge was at Nicholas Street. (There was a buggy and 
        footbridge across the canal by 1910; the Pretoria Bridge was not built 
        until 1917.) So the church kept a rowboat and hired someone to row it 
        (at the cost of fifteen cents &quot;ferriage&quot;) so that the west-side 
        members of the congregation (the larger number) could get to church during 
        the summer months.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Imagine those churchgoers from across the canal. The men would be in 
        their Sunday suits and high, stiff collars, the women in their starched, 
        bustled dresses, hatted and gloved, sitting upright in the boat, doing 
        their best to keep the children from falling - or diving - overboard. 
        Were they solemn as one always imagines nineteenth-century churchgoers 
        to have been? Or did they view the boating exercise as a lark?<br>
      </p>
      <p>It would most certainly have been hot and uncomfortable in the little 
        church, and more than one person would, no doubt, have prayed for Mr. 
        Phillips to preach a brief sermon. Conscientious man that he clearly was, 
        he would likely have given it all he had, but he might have kept it brief 
        as he had to preach a whole new sermon that evening before he could settle 
        down to prepare his school lessons for the next day.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In winter, the over-the-canal parishioners could walk - or skate - to 
        church, but the church was probably as cold then as it was hot in summer. 
        And it was smoky. Ted Gunderson was nine years old when the church was 
        built. He grew up in it, was married in it and later served as both peoples' 
        warden and treasurer at Ascension. He wrote a memoir for the church's 
        100th anniversary booklet. In it, he described the long, pot-bellied stove 
        in Holy Trinity's early years. It stood just inside the front door, and 
        its stovepipe right angled near the ceiling and, held in place by wire, 
        crossed the church, presumably to vent somewhere in the sanctuary wall. 
        As the wood was &quot;often times green,&quot; Mr. Gunderson wrote, &quot;it 
        caused dense smoke, and we choked, coughed and had red eyes, and sat in 
        smelly clothes.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>Heat and cold were the least of the difficulties people had to deal with. 
        The 1870s and '80s were hard times, in some ways, even for the rich. Diseases, 
        for which cures have since been found, regularly carried away more than 
        one child in a family, and old graveyards give evidence of whole families 
        dying in a single week. No matter how smoky the church was, those winter 
        prayers must have been fervent. And the Christmas services, when all were 
        well, must have been joyful - and wonderful for the children. There would 
        be the pageant and the ever-new wonder of the Christ child's birth. Then, 
        for some, there might be the magical midnight skate over the canal.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Between 1882, when Thomas Phillips left to settle in the United States, 
        and 1885, when Holy Trinity became attached to St. John's on Mackenzie 
        Avenue in Ottawa, the church was in such financial trouble and the stipend 
        for the priest was so little, there was a succession of four priests (although 
        the first one was only a six-months fill-in until Thomas Phillips' successor 
        could be appointed). All the same, Holy Trinity was a lively church with 
        an organist, William Carter, who led a choir that Henry Pollard, the priest 
        from St. John's, called &quot;the best and most efficient in the county 
        of Carleton.&quot; The church also had a branch of The Brotherhood of 
        St. Andrew, an entertainment committee, a Working Club, and, by 1884, 
        an active Ladies' Guild. Ten years later, it had one of the first branches 
        of The Women's Auxiliary to the Missionary Society.<br>
        <br>
        The church must have seemed as promising as Thomas Phillips had told those 
        British churchmen twelve years earlier because, in 1889, Mr. Pollard and 
        thirty members of the Holy Trinity congregation met to discuss forming 
        a parish. The result was that Holy Trinity became the parish of Archville 
        that year with George Taylor as its priest. Still, when the annual vestry 
        meeting was held on a rainy April evening, the vestry secretary wrote 
        ironically in the minutes that it was held, &quot;to the usual small attendance 
        of six people&quot; - one of whom was the priest (still Henry Pollard). 
        He went on to describe a cozy scene of the six sitting around the box 
        stove in the church basement engaged in &quot;social converse&quot; and 
        &quot;oral combat.&quot; </p>
