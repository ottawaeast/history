      <p> There are people in our church now who were here when Arthur Caulfield 
        was priest. (He married Jean and Arthur Humphries in 1945). They remember 
        him as a quiet, somewhat straight-laced, but good man. Mr. Caulfield was 
        in his thirties when he came, a man still full of energy who had been 
        assistant priest at the Cathedral for four years before coming to Ascension. 
        He had good organizational abilities and, as well, he felt keenly the 
        need for &quot;the growth in the things of the spirit.&quot; Like Robert 
        Jefferson, he considered it essential for &quot;all the people in the 
        parish to know each other.&quot; <br>
      </p>
      <p>For this reason, he initiated the Ascension branch of The Church Year 
        Fellowship in 1946 (a movement established in the Diocese of Toronto) 
        and introduced a system of &quot;sacrificial giving&quot; to try to do 
        away with having to raise money with bazaars, bake sales and the like. 
        Reminiscent of the fuel boxes of a few years earlier, each member of the 
        Fellowship was to put aside one cent a day over and above his/her regular 
        giving. The priest took the special envelope to the fellowship member 
        every week and, in this way, not only ensured the giving, but also kept 
        in close touch with his parishioners. The Fellowship met once a month, 
        and every year there was a Festival of Light service on the eve of the 
        Feast of the Presentation of Christ in the temple (then still called the 
        Purification of St. Mary the Virgin).<br>
      </p>
      <p>In his time, the vestry agreed to buy the two lots north of the church 
        for $3500.00, (and after repeated requests, agreed to fix the rectory's 
        garage doors so that Mr. Caulfield could get his car into the garage).<br>
      </p>
      <p>Earlier, when he'd been at St. Peter's Mission on Merivale Road, Mr. 
        Caulfield had helped set up the Anglican Young Peoples' Association there. 
        Later, he became president of the diocesan Sunday School Association, 
        and he always involved himself in work with young people. (This was a 
        good thing because his introduction to the parish had been to deal with 
        church hall windows that &quot;the boys from St. Patrick's next door had 
        broken, a problem that regularly plagued his years at Ascension). Mr. 
        Caulfield left Ascension in 1950 to be the priest at St. James in Perth. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Richard Crossley was quite different from Arthur Caulfield. Mr. Crossley 
        was an Englishman who had been camp chaplain at Petawawa, as well as priest 
        in Matawa and Chalk River. Both he and his wife Elva are still remembered 
        as being kind and friendly by those in the present congregation who were 
        children when he was here. Those who were adults remember, too, that he 
        was very understanding, a man to whom one could take troubles and be guaranteed 
        a real listener. He was also gifted with a great sense of humour and would 
        startle his congregation with swift, sharp remarks when he found them 
        dozing during his sermons. While there were those in the congregation 
        who felt that he was sometimes not sufficiently aware of the dignity his 
        position demanded, most enjoyed his wit. (One newspaper reporter called 
        one of Mr. Crossley's sermons &quot;pungently expressive.&quot;)<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mr. Crossley led the church through the difficult post-second-world-war 
        years. The Depression was over, but Canada was suffering from a staggering 
        war debt, and few people were well off. Ascension's parishioners still 
        sent bales to people inside the country (the diocese still sends bales 
        to the north) and every Christmas, sent a Christmas box to a priest and 
        his family in England where rationing was still very strict. <br>
        In 1950, one of the Crossleys' three children, their teen-aged daughter 
        Patricia, became very ill, and her Ottawa doctor wanted to send her to 
        Boston for treatment. It was going to be very expensive. The congregation 
        collected enough money for both the trip and the treatment. Patricia recovered, 
        and the grateful Crossleys gave the church the small window on the north 
        side of the chancel as a thanks offering. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In 1952, the year King George the sixth died, the parish finally decided 
        on a memorial to the two world wars. The memorial was a splendid electric 
        organ, a Wurlitzer with a chimes attachment that could be played through 
        the old bell tower under the memorial spire. (This was when the old railway-engine 
        bell was given to St. Augustine's in Newington). <br>
      </p>
      <p>Three years later, after the candlelight service on Christmas Eve, the 
        church mortgage was finally retired in a joyful ceremony in the church 
        hall. The congregation gathered around Ted Gunderson who held a large 
        plate. The paid-up mortgage agreement was put on the plate. Mrs. Teague 
        (the organist) lit a match and set fire to it - to much applause.<br>
      </p>
      <p>There was a much more solemn ceremony the next spring when the church 
        was consecrated by Bishop Ernest Reed. This took place on the evening 
        of May 9. The petition for consecration was presented to the bishop at 
        the church door by Mr. Crossley and wardens, D.A. Edgar and W. Boland. 
        The bishop accepted it with the words, &quot;Brethren, if this be your 
        desire, and the desire of the parishioners, we will now proceed to the 
        act of consecration.&quot; The wardens, rector and bishop, followed by 
        the rest of the congregation, proceeded from there into the church and 
        up the aisle to the chancel as they said the twenty-fourth psalm, The 
        Earth is the Lord's and all that therein is. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Then the bishop proceeded with the service of consecration, saying these 
        words just before the final blessing: &quot;Blessed by Thy Name, O Lord 
        God, for that it pleaseth thee to have thy habitation among the sons of 
        men, and to dwell in the midst of the assembly of the saints upon earth. 
        Bless, we beseech thee, the religious service of this day, and grant that, 
        in this place now set apart to thy service, thy holy name may be worshipped 
        in truth and purity to all generations. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. 
        Amen&quot;.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mr. Crossley served in this church for another six years. (N.B., he finally 
        got Arthur Caulfield's new garage.) Alfred Anderson replaced him in 1961 
        but died after only four and a half months. Edwin Allsopp, who replaced 
        Mr. Anderson, was here for ten years. All anyone seems to remember about 
        him now is that he was very proper, not much fun and a rather fussy, &quot;little 
        old man.&quot; </p>
