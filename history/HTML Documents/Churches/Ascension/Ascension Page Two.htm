        <b>THE NEW PARISH</b><br>
      </p>
      <p align="left">The new parish did not prosper at first. The congregation 
        was so small in the 1880s that most of its organizations had dwindled 
        and died. Within a year of taking the church, Mr. Taylor was gone, and 
        Holy Trinity came under the care of St. Barnabas in Ottawa. Its priest, 
        Thomas Bailey, took charge with the help of four Holy Trinity lay readers, 
        one of who, James Fletcher (of the original committee), was also the superintendent 
        of the Sunday school and teacher of the Bible class. In 1896 (the year 
        the diocese of Ottawa was formed), Holy Trinity was independent again, 
        and Frederick Squires became its rector. <br>
      </p>
      <p>In the nineteenth and through at least the first half of the twentieth 
        century, churches were not only spiritual but social centres in the lives 
        of their parishioners. They encompassed ladies' guilds, altar guilds, 
        sewing societies and their junior &quot;helpers&quot;, the Young Peoples' 
        Associations, the men's clubs, the branches of the Women's Auxiliary and 
        of the Brotherhood of St. Andrew. And there were drama societies and entertainment 
        committees to see to the lighter side of life in the church family.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mr. Squires wanted this kind of vitality for his church. A man then in 
        his middle years, he appears to have had plenty of energy and determination. 
        But, by 1899, Holy Trinity's financial situation was not good. In the 
        September minutes of that year's annual vestry meeting, Mr. Squires pointed 
        out that &quot;the church is in a precarious position and could be closed 
        at any time.&quot; He offered to &quot;take the debt of the church upon 
        his own shoulders.&quot; He advised the &quot;re-opening&quot; of the 
        Ladies Guild, the Sewing Society and other organizations - all of which 
        had fallen away. <br>
      </p>
      <p>&quot;With strenuous effort we would soon have our little church one 
        of the finest little churches around,&quot; he told his parishioners and 
        said that he hoped &quot;to leave the church in a better state than when 
        I found it.&quot; (All this when his own stipend was in arrears).<br>
        Things were still so bad (or worse) a year later that the parish considered 
        asking Mr. Squires to leave. They would put the church, once more, under 
        the care of a more prosperous parish. (The missions of Hawthorne and Leitrim, 
        attached to the parish in 1899, were given up in 1904.)<br>
      </p>
      <p>Mr. Squires did not leave. He was Holy Trinity's priest for nineteen 
        years, and under his direction, finances were stabilized and the parish 
        grew. The mortgage on the church was soon reduced to $1,030, and the &quot;reopened&quot; 
        Sewing Society (membership fee: seventy-five cents) made it its goal to 
        reduce it further. (With the church's weekly intake of between seven and 
        eight dollars, those women really had to sew!) Fifty-four dollars was 
        collected towards the installation of electric lights. As well, the parish 
        women furnished the church with a new altar (since the old had been given 
        to St. Columba in Manor Park). There was enough money now to send bales 
        (bundles of clothing) to mission churches in the west and to support a 
        blind boy in India.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The teen-age girls formed a junior sewing society, called The Cheerful 
        Workers. Those girls must have taken up the challenge and thrown themselves 
        into their work with missionary zeal because by the end of 1904, the amount 
        of the debt was only $376.96. (All the same, the church took out a new 
        mortgage in 1905). That same year, the Altar Guild presented to the church 
        three brass vases, complete with artificial flowers for the altar, paid 
        for with money from the Guild's bazaar. And the pennies the sixty-five 
        Sunday school children had been saving for three years added up to enough 
        to pay for The Good Shepherd window that is now the west window of Ascension. 
        And the church acquired a bell.<br>
      </p>
      <p>So far, no amount of research can make the several stories (or the dates) 
        concerning the acquisition of this bell come together. What's certain 
        is that the bell was a bit of serendipity that resulted from a railway 
        accident. In his memoir, Ted Gunderson wrote that it came from a train 
        engine that fell into the water in 1904 from the canal bridge. (The railway 
        bridge spanned the canal just north of the footbridge). The keepers of 
        railway lore have a record of just such an accident in 1891 and of an 
        accident in 1907, in which the engine did not quite fall into the canal 
        but was suspended precariously over it for several hours. Nothing in 1904.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Whichever accident it was, Joseph Leslie, one of Holy Trinity's wardens, 
        negotiated with the Canada Atlantic Railway for the bell. He got it, and 
        the bell was ceremoniously hoisted up into the steeple of the church, 
        where its cheerful clang brought the faithful to church every Sunday until 
        1967, when it was given to the church of St. Augustine in Newington.<br>
      </p>
      <p>A much more disastrous railway accident was the occasion for one of the 
        stained- glass windows now on the west wall of Ascension. Alfred Parks, 
        a long-time active member of the congregation, was an engine driver for 
        the Grand Trunk Railway. When a passenger train he was driving struck 
        a broken rail on the track between the spa at Carlsbad Springs and Hawthorne, 
        five miles outside Ottawa, the engine capsized, and the cars were derailed. 
        Six of the twenty-two passengers were injured (among them Rural Dean George 
        Taylor). Both the fireman and engineer Parks were scalded to death by 
        the steam. Alfred Parks was forty-two years old. His widow and children 
        gave the church the window in his memory.<br>
      </p>
      <p>That same year, James Fletcher died, and Captain Charles Winter took 
        over the job of Sunday school superintendent. Dr. Fletcher was so well 
        liked that the congregation bought the brass lectern in his memory. As 
        well as being a founding member of Holy Trinity, he was lay reader, superintendent 
        of Sunday school and Bible-class teacher. The authors of the 1956 church 
        history wrote about Dr. Fletcher: &quot;Any person who came under his 
        guidance was privileged indeed.&quot;<br>
        Although the church itself still wasn't very comfortable - Ted Gunderson 
        remembered Mr. Squires delivering his sermons with his eyes closed because 
        of the stinging smoke - the parish was better off. It now had, in addition 
        to its other organizations, a boys club, called The Boys Brigade (complimented 
        in one set of vestry minutes for &quot;the improvement of the boys' conduct 
        and bearing&quot;), an elaborate Christmas Festival and an annual summer 
        sports day. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Mr. Squires saw the congregation through the worry of the South African 
        War - in which one member of the congregation, Robert Bradley, was killed; 
        the window now on the east wall of Ascension is a memorial to him. And 
        Mr. Squires was still Holy Trinity's priest when the First World War started 
        in August of 1914. <br>
      </p>
      <p>While there's nothing in the church records to say exactly what Holy 
        Trinity's parishioners did during the war, the Sewing Society, under the 
        direction of the Red Cross, would have been making sheets and bandages 
        for the wounded, and sewing for the orphaned and displaced children in 
        Belgium. They would, too, have been filling boxes with their knitted socks, 
        food and treats for &quot;the boys in khaki&quot; and taking part in concerts 
        to raise money for the Red Cross. Prayers for those soldiers, the sailors 
        and the nurses overseas must have been long and deeply felt and every 
        voice lifted to the height of the church in the singing of hymns like 
        Eternal Father Strong to Save and Oh God our Help in Ages Past.<br>
        At the same time, the ordinary life of the church went on. Frederick Squires' 
        relations with his parishioners had become strained - possibly because 
        he so often engaged in acrimonious discussions with them about his stipend. 
        In 1915, Mr. Squires and his wife moved to an apartment on Elgin street 
        but by now, there was so little money that his stipend was cut from $800 
        to $600 and then to $400. He left Ascension. In fact, the bishop (the 
        newly elected John Charles Roper) retired him, and he left Canada to return 
        to England to take a parish somewhere in Norfolk. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Mark Malbert, who followed him, stayed only a year, after which the bishop 
        appointed him as full-time priest to the Ottawa Hebrew Mission. </p>
