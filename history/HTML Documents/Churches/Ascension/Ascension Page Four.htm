        <b>DEPRESSION YEARS</b> </div>
      <p>The New York Stock Exchange crash that started the Great Depression happened 
        in the fall of 1929. The &quot;bad times&quot; when so many people were 
        out of work and so many had to rely on soup kitchens for their only sustenance 
        lasted for ten years. The plea for money, for parishioners to support 
        their church, a running theme through the church's whole history, has 
        never been more poignant than in these Depression years. There was never 
        a &quot;fixed charge for sitting&quot; in Ascension's pews but, as Francis 
        Wimberly said at one annual vestry meeting, &quot;donations are hoped 
        for.&quot; Wistful words. Mr. Wimberly, who succeeded Robert Jefferson 
        as priest, donated part of his $200-per-year stipend to the church in 
        1932, and, at some point in the mid 1930s, Ted Gunderson, then parish 
        treasurer, had to go to the bank to borrow money to pay the arrears owed 
        to the coal company and to Mr. Wimberley. The bank manager was reluctant 
        to lend the church the $1,000 without collateral. In his memoir, Mr. Gunderson 
        wrote, &quot;I explained our people were faithful and the property was 
        actually backed by the diocese of Ottawa. I also advised them I had a 
        new automobile and I would put this up as collateral.&quot; He got the 
        loan. The coal dealer and the reverend both got their money.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Straightaway, Mr. Gunderson suggested to the Advisory Board that &quot;in 
        order to offset further embarrassment&quot; every household have a box, 
        to be called &quot;the fuel box,&quot; in which to put a penny every day. 
        Coal cost between seven and eight dollars a ton per year so, &quot;With 
        the hope of $3.65 from every box at the end of the year,&quot; there would 
        be &quot;ample&quot; to pay for the coal. (He did not mention how the 
        priest's stipend was to be paid.) The first year brought in $400, so the 
        penny-a-day system was followed until both the church and the rectory 
        were converted to oil. (What poor Mr. Wimberley - or Adrian Bender who 
        succeeded him in 1935 - lived on is anybody's guess.) <br>
      </p>
      <p>Impoverished though so many of them were, Ascension's people supported 
        one another through those rough times, and they created times of fellowship. 
        The prayer circle, the Dramatic Society, the Men's Club, The Brotherhood 
        of St. Andrew, the Women's Auxiliary were all active, and Mr. Jefferson's 
        tennis club was still going strong. (As late as 1940, at the annual vestry 
        meeting, there was a heated discussion about the morality - or the propriety 
        - of tennis being played &quot;on the Sabbath.&quot;) The Babies Branch, 
        now called Little Helpers, was active (At one annual party, there were 
        twenty-two mothers, thirty-eight children, nine W.A. members and four 
        visitors. The two cakes cost forty-five cents, the cookies, thirty- six 
        cents). The Sunday school was thriving, as was the Young Peoples' Association; 
        there were active Boy Scout and Cub Scout troops, and, the Depression 
        notwithstanding, a rectory was built in 1932 on the land that had been 
        bought nine years earlier. It cost $5,000, money raised over twelve years 
        by the Ladies' Guild. There was money enough to keep up Ascension's portion 
        of the diocesan's mission fund and to send bales to the mission churches 
        in the west and to the Arctic. (The prairie drought is described in one 
        vestry account as, &quot;the western difficulty.&quot;)<br>
      </p>
      <p>Francis Wimberly (an Englishman who had, early on, been in mission churches 
        in western Canada, came to Ascension from North Gower) was a strong leader 
        and a kind man about whom one of his parishioners said, &quot;that the 
        parish survived [the Depression] and the activities continued was in no 
        small way due to his leadership.&quot; Mr. Wimberley left in 1935, and 
        Adrian Bender came from Pakenham to succeed him. Mr. Bender saw the parish 
        through the last years of the Depression, the Second World War and the 
        church's 90th anniversary.<br>
