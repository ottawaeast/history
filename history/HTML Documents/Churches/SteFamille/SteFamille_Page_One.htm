            <p>By the end of the Nineteenth Century, the Catholic community had 
              grown to a point where a new parish, church and school were required 
              to meet the needs of the French Canadian and Irish residents of 
              Ottawa East Village. In 1900 a delegation met with Monsignor Duhamel 
              of the Archdiocese and requested a new parish for the area. He enlisted 
              the support of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate and in that year the 
              Saint-Famille (Holy Family) Parish was created. This new congregation 
              acted as a focal point for Catholics in the area and was instrumental 
              in the creation of a separate school board, Holy Family School and 
              a new church.</p>
            <p>Ste-Famille Church was the second official church built in Ottawa 
              East. Official because the church actually began in temporary quarters 
              in the Oblates venerable &quot;White House&quot; situated next to 
              the Scholasticate. It also served as temporary quarters for the 
              newly created Catholic School. The church was built on what is now 
              Oblate Avenue, just off Main St. across from the present-day Sacr&eacute;-Coeur 
              Convent. Built in 1902, the building was replaced in 1959 with the 
              new structure on Glenora Ave. </p>

      <p>Many might be surprised to discover that the community of Ottawa East 
        can add yet one more church to its already impressive list, but it can 
        and a very special one at that. Rather than being right on Main Street, 
        Sainte-Famille Church is discreetly nestled away on Glenora Avenue.</p>
      <p>It saw the day on the crisp and bright afternoon of October 25th, 1959. 
        Following a blessing ceremony by Archbishop Joseph Lemieux, parishioners 
        and friends celebrated the construction of a new church, a project that 
        took three years from start to finish. </p>
      <p>This was a turning point in the parish's history. Did you know that our 
        registry can boast of records of the first baptism, wedding and funeral 
        dating back as far as 1901? Ottawa East was still a village when Bishop 
        Duhamel responded to a request from 105 Catholic families - 55 French 
        Canadian and 50 Irish - to open a separate school and erect a parish to 
        be administered by the Oblate Fathers. Sainte-Famille became not only 
        a religious, but a social rallying point for the Franco-Ontarian community.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The first chapel, school and parish hall were briefly housed in the White 
        House, a modest wood <a href="../../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/ssj_11_Schol_Maison_from_river_winter.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/sm/ssj_11_Schol_Maison_from_river_winter_sm.jpg" width="200" height="133" align="right" border="0" alt="Rear view of the White House and Scholasticate"></a>construction 
        located beside St-Joseph Scholasticate (Deschatelet), which was demolished 
        in the fifties. In September of 1901, a school opened on Main, close to 
        Hazel. The construction of a church on Oblate Avenue took six months, 
        from April to October 1902. For the next ten years, all sorts of fund-raising 
        activities took place - sugar bushes, summer picnics, horse rides and 
        other parties. A quote from a July 1902 newspaper illustrates one of these 
        activities: &quot;One of the most pleasant festivities of Dominion Day 
        was a Strawberry Festival to assist Holy Family Church in Ottawa East 
        ... It was a continuous performance from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. ... The scene 
        of the picnic was a large and shady grove, forming part of the grounds 
        of the Oblate Scholasticate on the banks of the Rideau River. The framework 
        of the new church rising up a little to the right of the scholasticate 
        was gaily decorated with flags ... There are a number of French-Canadians 
        in the Parish, so the Tricolor was in evidence, but the Union Jack was 
        the prominent note of decoration, having a good accessory in the green 
        flag with the Irish harp.&quot; (Editor's Note: The complete article has 
        been <a href="../../1901_Snapshot/1901%20Snapshot%20Strawberry.htm">reproduced 
        here</a>)<br>
      </p>
      <p>For three decades, Holy Family Parish developed as a bilingual parish 
        and became exclusively French in <a href="../../Image%20Library/Buildings/Schools/CA7682_School_De_Mazenod_.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/Buildings/Schools/sm/CA7682_School_De_Mazenod_sm.jpg" width="165" height="113" align="left" border="0" alt="De Mazenod School - still standing on Main St." vspace="3" hspace="3"></a>1930. 
        With the opening of <a href="../../Schools/De%20Mazenod.htm">De Mazenod 
        School</a> in 1934, this marked the beginning of half a century of continuous 
        growth. However, transition did not come easily for all. In many families, 
        spouses had roots in different linguistic groups. For years after, several 
        chose to be registered in both <a href="../CanMartyrs/CanMartyrs_Page_One.htm">Canadian 
        Martyrs </a>and Sainte-Famille parishes, enabling worship in one's mother 
        tongue.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Until 1956, the Parish remained under the direction of the Oblate Fathers. 
        Then came a radical shock. The late Charles Bruyere, journalist, described 
        it as such: &quot;Puis en 1956, on peut imaginer la stupeur, la consternation 
        qui s' emparerent des anciens paroissiens de Sainte-Famille, lorsqu'ils 
        apprirentque les bons Peres Oblats allaient, pour des raisons jamais divulguees 
        officiellement, remettre la paroisse qu'ils avaient fondee entre les mains 
        des auto rites diocesaines, qui devaient en confier la direction au clerge 
        seculier&quot;. *</p>
      <p>With this transfer from the Oblate Fathers to the diocesan secular clergy 
        and the arrival of Father Jean-Paul Poirier, a new era began. Sainte-Famille 
        was the first to have a Parish Council where the leaders of the various 
        committees met monthly to advise the parish priest collectively. In the 
        seventies, as many as eight committees played an active role. One of their 
        many accomplishments was the celebration of the 75th anniversary on May 
        2, 1976 and the writing of the 80-year history of Sainte-Famille, on which 
        the historical portion of this article is based.</p>
      <p>The winds of change associated with the sixties were deeply felt in the 
        Church and Sainte-Famille was no exception. Throughout the seventies and 
        eighties came a series of meaningful experiences and transformations. 
        Financial difficulties in the early 80s put at risk the very survival 
        of the Parish. This lead to a significant turning point. A group of parishioners 
        categorically rejected the thought of selling the building and organized 
        an ad hoc committee to address this urgent issue. Innovative solutions 
        reflecting the determination of the community were found. With the help 
        of Father Gratien Girod, with the Parish since 1981, came the birth of 
        a pastoral project which would ensure the survival of a francophone parish. 
        Looking back now, administrative and financial restructuring undertaken 
        at the time has contributed to the creation of a vibrant community life.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Since then, two outstanding themes have motivated us to grow - hospitality 
        or the French word, ACCUEIL, and sharing or PARTAGE. These have been and 
        remain our guiding principles. When one belongs to Sainte-Famille Parish, 
        one embraces respect for the other's differences. Above all, this is reflected 
        in the sharing of our church with a strong and growing Spanish speaking 
        community of people from nine or so different countries.<br>
