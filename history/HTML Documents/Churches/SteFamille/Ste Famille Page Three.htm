    <td>Fall soon gives way to winter and the Feast of St-Nicholas sets the tone 
      for Christmas preparations. Children have a special place at Ste-Famille. 
      In addition to the weekly<a href="../../Image%20Library/Buildings/Churches/X_stefamille%20font.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/Buildings/Churches/sm/X_stefamille%20font%20sm.jpg" width="146" height="172" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="3" alt="Ste. Famille baptismal font" border="0"></a> 
      children's liturgy during mass, this feast held on the first Sunday in December, 
      is a truly joyous occasion and has become a very important tradition for 
      young and old. St-Nicholas is the centre of attraction, but he is always 
      well-surrounded by children dressed in traditional costumes. Small gifts 
      are exchanged, followed by coffee and sweets which are then served in the 
      Church hall. The Feast of St-Nicholas is yet another expression of the yearly 
      theme reminding us of how we can deepen our faith and render it more meaningful 
      and closer to every day life. Response for a collection of food stocks for 
      the Shepherds of Good Hope is always very generous. 
      <p>No sooner has the Christmas season left us and we are already planning 
        for Easter. Joint celebrations involving the French and Spanish-speaking 
        communities were rehearsed. It was truly a celebration this year, an occasion 
        to welcome Spring in all of its splendour. On April 29th, we inaugurated 
        our lovely stained glass window, an ambitious project completed over only 
        18 months, the artist being Josef Aigner, originally from Munich, <a href="../../Image%20Library/Buildings/Churches/X_stefamille2.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/Buildings/Churches/sm/X_stefamille2%20sm.jpg" width="150" height="107" align="left" vspace="3" hspace="3" alt="Ste. Famille stained glass window" border="0"></a>Germany, 
        now living in Toronto. The International Year of the Family and the 1994 
        Parish theme of COME CELEBRATE LIFE were the driving forces behind the 
        success of this project. For both practical (light and heat) and aesthetic 
        reasons, the idea of installing this window represented a concrete example 
        of a joint venture between the two communities - French and Spanish. Designed 
        by one of the parishioners, Monique Laperriere, she briefly describes 
        its symbolism: &quot;By its warm and luminous colours and by its cosmic 
        motion, this work of art strives to be the reflection of God, Creator 
        of beauty, the Source of Light and Life. For me, colour and movement become 
        words, expressing a greater closeness to the cosmic Christ. It communicates 
        the Word of God and the joy of creation.&quot; The stained glass window 
        is composed of more than 600 individual pieces paid for by parishioners 
        and by many well-wishers. Thank you to all. The artist, Josef Aigner, 
        originally from Munich, Germany, and now living in Toronto, attended the 
        April 29th event.</p>
      <p>Two other examples of artistic talent adorn the front of the Church - 
        the baptismal font and tabernacle. The artist and parishioner, Mimi Boudreault, 
        explains their significance in her own words: &quot;Without magic ... 
        with clay, these works represent a personal offering to the Creator of 
        the Universe. Using the Japanese Rakti method of modelling clay and sculpting 
        wood, the creation of the baptismal font and tabernacle express the heart 
        of Sainte-Famille. The symbols of life and hope and the resounding silence 
        found in a potter's workshop ...&quot;</p>
      <p>What does the future hold for Sainte-Famille Parish? More joint activities 
        - both pastoral and cultural involving both communities - are definitely 
        on the agenda.<br>
      </p>
      We enjoyed participating in this year's Main Street Garage Sale, held on 
      May 13th in the park next to St. Paul's University. Various fund-raising 
      events: such as bingos, are on going, with the main project being the completion 
      of major renovations to the Church's roof-hopefully before the snow flies! 
      <p>Receipts from the placing of ads in our Parish Bulletin ($100 per year) 
        and the rental of our basement hall ($350 per event - who could resist 
        this free publicity?) are most welcome!</p>
      <p>Sainte-Famille is a home away from home. A special mention here can be 
        made concerning the students from St. Paul's University who enrich our 
        celebrations. However, parishioners are not limited to the immediate Canal 
        area. Many come from throughout the city and from across the Ottawa River. 
        Recent correspondence from afar - Belgium, Germany and Guyana - reminds 
        us that we are a special Parish and not easily forgotten.</p>
      <p><br>
        In conclusion, we can say that if Sainte-Famille has been able to flourish 
        from its founding to the present, it is because of the quality of the 
        religious leadership and the sharing of a vision. Since 1981, Gratien 
        Girod has been our parish priest. When he is away, we have been blessed 
        by the presence of others - Jacques Kabangu, Andre Babusia, Antonio de 
        Souza - to whom we owe our appreciation and thanks.</p>
