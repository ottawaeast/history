      <p>At Sainte-Famille, we extend a standing invitation to those without a 
        home or community. For example, last spring, we held a special mass which 
        was celebrated with members of the Rawandan community, many of whom lost 
        relatives and close friends in the massacre in their home country. A similar 
        service was quickly organized to comfort those who suffered from tragedy 
        in Madagascar. Indeed, Sainte-Famille is a place where everyone can contribute 
        in his or her own way, with full recognition of the wealth that a true 
        Mosaic can bring.</p>
      <p>The parishioners of Sainte-Famille have a history of undertaking and 
        making projects <a href="../../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/ssj_47_Ste_Famille_parisheners.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/sm/ssj_47_Ste_Famille_parisheners_sm.jpg" width="170" height="117" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="3" alt="Original parishoners - beside church - no date" border="0"></a>happen. 
        The best illustration of this is how people took action to allow their 
        priest to take a year's sabbatical. Not only did parishioners find a replacement 
        for him, but they helped him assume the cost of his trip to Europe.</p>
      <p><br>
        While the actual management of the Parish continues to be done on a purely 
        volunteer basis, the overall direction is provided by the, Executive which 
        is democratically elected by the Parish Council; both meet on a regular 
        basis throughout the year.</p>
      <p><br>
        The Parish's year of activities usually begins in late August or early 
        September when members of the French, Spanish and African communities 
        meet and spend a day together. A theme is chosen and developed that will 
        guide us throughout the year. Past themes are A living and responsible 
        Christian community (Une communaute chretienne, vivante et<br>
        responsable and Come Celebrate Life. (Viens celebrer la Vie). </p>
      <p><br>
        Last year, we chose to celebrate life together by overcoming age, language 
        and cultural <a href="../../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/ssj_46_Ste_Famille_altar_c1920%27s.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/sm/ssj_46_Ste_Famille_altar_c1920%27s_sm.jpg" width="200" height="124" align="left" vspace="3" hspace="3" border="0" alt="Original altar of Ste. Famille in the 1920's"></a>barriers. 
        Quite a challenge you would say! How does one do it? Clay was the answer 
        and the theme became, To become clay in Your Hands (Etre argile entre 
        tes mains). By working clay with our hands, not only we were able to create 
        a series of creative and somewhat unusual objects later put on display 
        in the' Church, but we overcame our initial fear of not knowing one another. 
        We were able to express our feelings and to build valuable links amongst 
        ourselves. To culminate the day, three colourful balloons were launched 
        to symbolize the three communities' efforts to strive for<br>
        greater understanding and co-operation. This yearly activity or as we 
        say, JOURNEE DE RESSOURCEMENT, helps us grow and blossom as a Christian 
        community. And just so we don't forget, our monthly bulletin is a constant 
        reminder of the chosen theme. Parishioners are invited to contribute articles 
        that will enhance it and encourage us to reflect upon it.<br>
