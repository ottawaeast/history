      <p>sion field had requested bandages. Such was the nature of mission projects 
        carried on by the Sunday School and other church organizations. Support 
        for the Thomas Crosby mission boat, native Christian children at Birch 
        River, Manitoba and adoption of foreign foster children give further evidence 
        of Wesley's desire to be useful abroad. These projects were in addition 
        to the regular contributions of the congregation to the Mission and Service 
        Fund of the United Church of Canada.</p>
      <p>Closer to home, the possibility of joint summer services with the Church 
        of the Ascension was discussed in 1972 and a trial venture in a co-operative 
        Sunday School with Ascension, first announced at the Official Board meeting 
        of September 15, 1971, was subsequently implemented. An ecumenical hymn 
        sing was held at the Ste. Famille RC. Church on May 7, 1972 in which the 
        choirs of Church of the Ascension and Wesley United participated with 
        soloists and musical groups Ste. Famille and Canadian Martyrs Roman Catholic 
        churches. That musical evening was one of the last special events shared 
        with the Rosses at Wesley as Rev. Col. Ross accepted a call to Victoria's 
        Esquimalt United Church and left Ottawa in July of the same year.</p>
      <p>Wesley continued its efforts to maintain a high profile in the community 
        by allowing the use of its building and facilities by acceptable groups; 
        weight-loss, exercise and dance organizations, rehearsal site for musicians, 
        polling station at election time, etc. As well, the Sunday School, U.C.W. 
        and other willing groups within the church were encouraged to sponsor 
        social events, not simply as a means of raising money, but as an endeavour 
        to spread even further, the influence of Wesley United Church through 
        those who entered its doors for whatever purpose. Such was the established 
        norm when a new pastor carne to minister at Wesley. In September of 1972, 
        the Rev. Robert P. Condon, RC.AF., retired, as-sumed the pastorship and 
        retained the position until his retirement from the active ministry in 
        June of 1978. He and his wife, Margaret remained faithful members of Wesley 
        and in 1980, Rev. Condon was named Minister Emeritus, an honour he held 
        until his death in 1985. Following Rev. Condon in the succession of ministers 
        at Wesley was the Rev. Donald R McDonald who came to our church from Moose 
        Jaw, Saskatchewan. He was inducted into his position here at an impressive 
        service on Thursday, September 14, 1978.</p>
      <p>Although a general decline in membership was taking its toll, the choir 
        under the direction of organist and choir director, Grace Davies, presented 
        a cantata at Christmas, 1974 and performed original music on June 8, 1975, 
        when Wesley observed the fiftieth anniversary of the United Church. Among 
        the hymns sung during the special service that day was one written especially 
        for the occasion by Cyril Chapman and dedicated to Wesley's congregation.3 
        Another special service was held May 8, 1977 - this time in celebration 
        of the silver jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The service, co-ordinated 
        by James MacFarlane, included a special choral introit using suitable 
        words set to Wesley's own tune, Celebration.4 Guests in-cluded the Masonic 
        Men's Choir directed by T.I. Davies, His Excellency, the British High 
        Commissioner, Sir John Johnson who read the Scripture and the Hon. Claude 
        Bennett, M.P.P., then Minister of Industry and Tourism, who delivered 
        the address. Following the service, the congregation enjoyed tea in the 
        church hall where memorabilia associated with the Royal Family and Commonwealth 
        countries were dis-played.</p>
      <p>The advent of the 1980's found the Official Board considering major expenses 
        in building improvements. The first expenditure of note was made in 1978 
        after a chronically ailing heating plant finally caused a fire to break 
        out in the boiler room. Fortunately the caretaker, Tom Davies, was close 
        at hand and his appropriate action allowed little damage. The mishap led 
        to the installation of a new oil burner and suitable repairs to ancillary 
        equipment. Besides regular maintenance requirements, two sub-</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 32</b></p>
      <p>jects of concern were considered and action taken. At an Official Board 
        meeting in January of 1971, the Committee of Stewards had reported that 
        it was suggested by an organ repair firm that a sum of from three to five 
        hundred dollars would extend the life of the organ &quot;at least another 
        twenty years&quot;. In 1981, however, an account in excess of $330 was 
        paid to make immediate necessary repairs to the or-gan with the prospect 
        of another expenditure approaching two thousand dollars to properly overhaul 
        the instrument. Because of its age and the uncertainty of securing replacement 
        parts in the event of a major breakdown,- the Committee of Stewards, at 
        its April, 1982 meeting, decided to form an organ committee to investigate 
        prices and availability of a suitable organ with a view to initiating 
        an organ fund. A committee consisting of Cyril Chapman, Wayne Pointen 
        and Dorothy Murchison was formed and when the suggestion of a fund was 
        placed before the Official Board, it was decided to call a special meeting 
        of the congregation to propose the question and call a vote. The meeting 
        was subsequently held and, although the vote was affirmative, there arose 
        a question of precisely what the congregation had approved. h was therefore 
        decided that the committee continue with its inquiries and bring the question 
        back to the congregation later in the year at which time, firm support 
        or rejection would be sought. The issue was finally settled at a special 
        congregational meeting on November 14, 1982, when the motion to establish 
        the fund was earned with an amending suffix forestalling purchase of any 
        instrument when finds became avail-able, without further recourse to the 
        congregation. Although permission to actually replace the organ was withheld, 
        the fund was initiated with a sum of $4,125 and notice of intent from 
        the U.C.W. to provide a further four thousand dollars.</p>
      <p>Concurrently with the organ fund matter, Wesley joined with society in 
        general in seeking ways to reduce energy consumption, particularly in 
        the heating of the building. Three circulating fans were in-stalled over 
        the sanctuary at a cost of $615 by George Bolton, Ltd., with funds supplied 
        partly by private donors and by the Sunday School. The Committee of Stewards' 
        Leonard Merrifield made a survey of the building and reported his findings 
        and suggestions for further energy conservation. The committee accepted 
        his report in which he noted that doors and windows were in need of weather 
        stripping and caulking, etc. and that were the oil burner replaced with 
        a gas-fired unit., B substantial saving in fuel costs would be realized.. 
        This would include conversion of the propane kitchen range as well as 
        the water heater to natural gas. The recommendations were placed before 
        the Official Board at its meeting of October 7, 1982 and it was agreed 
        to proceed with the conversion. The Committee of Stewards accepted the 
        lowest of four bids - Clement Marchand Natural Gas Services, at a price 
        of$3,105. Leonard Merrifield drew up an agreement with the contractor 
        which the committee chairman, Cyril Chapman signed on 0ctober 13th. The 
        job was completed in December. Since most members of the Trustee Board 
        were also Stewards, this was a co-operative project.</p>
      <p>1983 marked the 75th year of Wesley's existence and various projects 
        were planned for anniversary celebrations. An Anniversary Committee composed 
        of W.AG. Kennedy, Mr. and Mrs. AH. Halvorson, C. B. Chapman, Mrs. W.J. 
        (Peg) Irvine, Cedric Dale, Wayne. Pointen and Rev. Donald McDonald met 
        to formal plans and activities and decide which should be church-wide 
        projects and which might be assumed various organizations. Some suggestions 
        included a special service each month involving invited speakers and musical 
        groups, a church photo directory similar to one produced in 1972, an anniversary 
        dinner (that tradition as an annual event had lapsed), an autumn concert 
        and unlisted projects of individual groups. One project that was implemented 
        was the production of the history of the church from its beginning to 
        the end of 1982. It was completed by Cyril Chapman, using records and 
        previous accounts, typed by Nancy Chapman and collated and bound by church 
        volunteers. The finished product - if an ongoing account can ever be called 
        finished -was subtitled Ottawa East's Methodist Heritage and this issue 
        is a revised and updated version of that record.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 33</b></p>
      <p align="center"><b>XV</b></p>
      <p>During the seventy-fifth anniversary year, several items and events planned 
        by the Anniversary Committee were carried out The weekly bulletin was 
        headed, &quot;75th Anniversary Year&quot; and bore the two chosen anniversary 
        themes: Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today and forever and &quot;Behold, 
        I make all things new&quot;, Brief historic facts concerning the church 
        were included in several bulletins throughout the year. Two white cloth 
        banners, lettered in red and blue and trimmed in gold, hung flanking the 
        cross and drapery on the chancel wall during 1983. Originally designed 
        by Cyril Chapman, they were beautifully hand-crafted by Amy Drake. The 
        project was arranged and co-ordinated by Georgena Halvorson and Peg Irvine. 
        Rev. McDonald arranged a year-long display table upon which were placed 
        photos and memorabilia of historic value; some taken from archives and 
        others loaned by church members. The U. C.W. con-tributed by having the 
        furniture in the ministers study recovered and production of a church 
        photo directory became the responsibility of the minister and Leonard 
        Merrifield. With the help of committee members, the directories were completed 
        and distributed in November.</p>
      <p>By coincidence, a highlight of the anniversary celebrations in 1983 turned 
        out to be the installation and dedication of a new organ. Following initial 
        investigation, the organ committee had recommended a Rodgers electronic 
        organ at a current cost of $15,000 as a suitable replacement for the existing 
        instrument. Further research during the summer of 1982 served to reinforce 
        its original recommendation with the realization that by the time the 
        congregation raised $15,000., the price of the organ (or its successor) 
        would be in excess of that figure. During December, a $20,000. Rodgers 
        organ-the next more expensive model than the one considered - was placed 
        in the church by Graham Parkin, local Rodgers representative, as a demonstrator 
        to be used during the Christmas season. Favourable comments from members 
        of the congregation outnumbered unfavourable and after some convincing 
        on the part of the or-gan committee, the congregation agreed to procure 
        a Rodgers organ. The quoted price of the demon-strated model, including 
        federal sales tax was $20,500. Serious negotiations mainly by William 
        Irvine with the company, allowed the Committee of Stewards to purchase 
        that model (the Jamestown) by trading the Wurlitzer organ plus $18,500. 
        The Committee of Stewards avoided paying the federal tax by having the 
        church dedicate the organ to members who gave their lives during the two 
        world wars. The organ was dedicated at the Easter Sunday service, April 
        3, 1983. The choir sponsored an inaugural recital by talent-ed student 
        organist Pamila Hoswitschka with flutist Maria Pelletier on June 5th, 
        with tickets selling at $3.00. A large audience enjoyed an excellent demonstration 
        of the wide range of sounds and expressions attainable on the new organ. 
        A loan of $2,300. made by the UC.W. towards the purchase was repaid with 
        8% interest by the Stewards the same year. The organ fund had realized 
        a total input of $22,896.54, including the UC.W. loan After purchasing 
        the organ and repaying the loan, a balance of over $2,000. remained. The 
        sum, with accrued interest, was transferred to the church's Building Fund 
        in 1984 and the organ account was closed.</p>
      <p>In recognition of the church's seventy-fifth anniversary, several special 
        Sunday services were planned, the first being the UC.W. service of January 
        16th in which Daphne Craig addressed the congregation. On February 20th, 
        Wesley welcomed the Rev. Edwardo Panganiban (&quot;Bishop Eddie&quot;) 
        , Bish-op Emeritus of the southern Lauzon district, United Church of Christ, 
        Philippines. That service was followed by lunch and an illustrated talk 
        in the church hall. Also at that service, memorials were dedi-cated to 
        the memory of five former Wesley members: Carol Ann Dale, Florence Henrietta 
        Dawson, Robert A. L. Hill, James E. MacFarlane and William Simpson Wilson 
        - all were active workers in various</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 34</b></p>
      <p>church organizations. For some time, the church had been closed during 
        July or August. In 1983, it was closed in August and the July services 
        were held at 10:00 a.m. Following the summer closing, additional memorials 
        were dedicated on September 11th to the memory of John Baron and May and 
        Alwyn Peters.</p>
      <p>On September 18, 1983, the Sunday service was shortened to allow the 
        worshippers to attend a congregational picnic at the Rideau Hill United 
        Church camp grounds near Osgoode, Ont. A bus and private cars left the 
        church and returned late in the afternoon. The event was a project of 
        the Session and was the ftrst picnic in which the congregation participated 
        since the termination of the Sunday School picnics held years earlier. 
        1</p>
      <p>Continuing with special services throughout the seventy-fifth anniversary 
        year, October 16th was declared &quot;Heritage Sunday&quot; and the congregation 
        received special greetings by speakers Tom Fletcher from McLeod-Stewarton 
        United Church and Bill Scrivens from Dominion-Chalmers. The Ottawa Welsh 
        Choir, which has sung at Wesley many times, was also on hand and, directed 
        by Irene Thompson, contributed to the service.2 October 23rd that year 
        was chosen to be Anniversary Sunday and for the second time in Wesley's 
        history, a Governor General of Canada and his wife were in attendance 
        and His Excel-lency, Edward Schreyer read the New Testament lesson from 
        Philippians 1. An original commemorative hymn written by Rev. McDonald 
        was sung for the first time. Entitled In the Fellowship of Faith, it was 
        sung to the tune of The Battle Hymn of the Republic 3. Another original 
        hymn by Rev. McDonald was sung for the ftrst time October 28, 1984. He 
        called it: We Have This Faith, and it was sung to the tune, Sine Nomine, 
        (For All The Saints).&quot; Although the Sunday School's first session 
        was in January of 1909, a special Sunday School anniversary service was 
        held on October 30th, the significance being that the school. was formed 
        one week after the congregation. On that occasion, the guest speaker was 
        Mr. George Brewe and the invited choir was that of Beryl Gregory of the 
        Seventh Day Adventist Church. 5 During the latter part of October, the 
        Sunday School promoted the wearing of period costumes by children and 
        adults, helping to grasp the spirit of older times.</p>
      <p>Anniversary dinners had become rare at Wesley by 1983, but a well attended 
        one, reminiscent of such affairs in days gone by, was held in the church 
        hall Monday evening, October 24th. Catering was arranged by Georgena Halvorson 
        and Peg Irvine on behalf of the U.C.W. Invited guests from neighbouring 
        and allied churches spoke briefly and extended the good wishes of their 
        congregations to Wesley; following which, the historic film of the building 
        of the present church was screened. A further U.C.W. gesture toward the 
        anniversary celebrations was the purchase of new blue gowns and reversible 
        white and gold collars for the choir. Sunday services at the year's end 
        included a December 4th Sunday School tribute to Grace Davies and Dorothy 
        Wallace, and the traditional Christmas Eve service conducted by the Sunday 
        School. drawing a congregation numbering 187.</p>
      <p>The sizeable expenditures for the organ, and other anniversary projects 
        in 1983 were followed by another costly item during the following year. 
        The windows at the front of the church (23 panes) had leaked for some 
        time and had been temporarily repaired by cau11cing. The Committee of 
        Stewards alerted the Trustees to the condition of the windows and rotting 
        wooden sills, and expressed the opinion that major repairs were required. 
        6 The Board of Trustees decided to replace the windows with amber coloured 
        glass in aluminum frames and one top opening window. The Official Board, 
        on February 26, 1984, approved the replacement of the windows and made 
        a request for donations. Of the total cost of $6,722, the sum of $4,100 
        was received by May from donations made by individuals, the Sunday School 
        the choir and a $2,000. contribution from the U.C.W.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 35</b></p>
      <p>Entering the decade of the 80's. the perennial concern for the church's 
        finances led to the Stewards' entry into the Com-Pac program. This was 
        a program designed to raise the level of giving of the congregation and 
        was concurrently implemented by a number of the city's United Churches. 
        Although not as intense as that of the Wells Organization, it was highly 
        organized and the structure included cluster meetings where financial 
        committees of the various churches met on a few occasions to compare notes 
        and share ideas. At Wesley, the congregation was made aware of the need 
        for improvement in church giving and, early in 1982, a slide show was 
        put together and presented by the Committee of Stewards. The slide-tape 
        audio visual presentation consisted of a series of colour slides of various 
        people and church subjects, put together in a story entitled &quot;Shortcut 
        Sam''7 The plot concerned the initial criticism of Sam toward the church's 
        &quot;always asking for money&quot;. and the ways in which he was given 
        to realize the importance and necessity of stewardship and the practice 
        of proportional giving. A central part of the program was the every member 
        canvass, a practice ftrst begun at Wesley in 1909. The program generated 
        a rise in giving, but only 55 returned pledge cards with a financial commitment, 
        represented just over fifty percent of the church's requirements. Even 
        so, the rise in weekly giving, based on pledges for 1983 exceeded that 
        of 1982 by more than 33%. In 1983, only 30 pledges were received but the 
        average weekly pledge per person of $10.68 covered over sixty percent 
        of that year's budget. In 1984, &quot;intention&quot; cards were distrib-uted. 
        Response to that type of appeal in subsequent years proved to be virtually 
        predictable at between 30 and 45 percent, thus prompting the Stewards 
        to discontinue the practice until very recently.</p>
      <p>In addition to the spending for the front windows and heating plant repairs 
        in 1984, the church received a Fire Marshall's Order listing improvements 
        and additions required to make the building con-form to current fire prevention 
        regulations. Stand-by emergency and exit lights were installed, glass 
        panels beside the front door to the sanctuary were replaced with a designated 
        fire rating type and the wooden panelling in the stairwell from the basement 
        to the front entrance was lined with fire retarding wall board. An automatic 
        closer was installed on the door at the head of those stairs and an additional 
        fire ex-tinguisher was procured. At the same time, a required-loading 
        notice was posted in the church hall, limit-ing the number of persons 
        lawfully using the facility to 148, and emergency exit route signs were 
        placed at appropriate places in the building. Building improvements continued 
        into 1985 with the installation of two more memorial stained glass windows. 
        The memorial to Peter Sinclair, Resurrection, was dedicated January 13th 
        and that of James MacFarlane: David and Jonathan, was dedicated February 
        10th.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>XVI</b></p>
      <p>1985, while not a momentous year in the life of Wesley, nonetheless was 
        a year in which some activities worth noting occurred. The once attractive 
        hedge bordering the Main St. and Graham Ave. frontages, had gradually 
        deteriorated to the point where much of it 'was merely a row of sparse, 
        unsightly trunks and the Trustees decided it should be removed.1 In considering
