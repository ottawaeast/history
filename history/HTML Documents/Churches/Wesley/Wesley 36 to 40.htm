      <p>Centre celebrating the 60th anniversary of the United Church of Canada. 
        At an impressive memorial service September 29th, a stained glass window 
        was dedicated to the memory of Pastor Emeritus, the Rev. Robert Condon, 
        who passed away July 30, 1985.</p>
      <p> Rev. D.R. McDonald announced his intention to retire from the active 
        ministry, effective June 30, 1986, following eight years of ministry at 
        Wesley. Accordingly, at a special meeting of the congrega-tion on November 
        17th, Presbytery Pastoral Relations Committee representatives, Les Fraser 
        and Alf Percival spoke to the congregation concerning the appointment 
        of a Pastoral Relations Committee for Wesley, and outlining the procedures 
        in calling a new minister. The committee was formed on December 9th and 
        set about its assignment to choose an appropriate candidate to place before 
        the congregation.2 The committee made its recommendation at a special 
        congregational meeting, February 13, 1986. Named was Rev. William Taylor 
        from Long Sault-Lunenburg pastoral charge. Rev. Taylor preached at Wesley 
        on Sunday, March 9th and the congregation elected to extend the call to 
        him. Ottawa Presbytery voted approval two days later. Unfortunately, Rev. 
        McDonald was unable to retain his duties until June 30th as planned because 
        of a heart attack suffered March 13th. He recovered, however, and was 
        well enough to assist in the Sacrament of Holy Communion, June 15th. Also 
        on that date, he and Mrs. McDonald (Kit), received a farewell gift of 
        $1,362 from the congregation. The McDonalds left for Kelowna, B.C. June 
        18, 1986.</p>
      <p>Rev. McDonald did not return to the pulpit before his departure. The 
        intervening Sunday ser-vices were conducted by various clergy and lay 
        preachers until the annual church closing in July. 3 August 10, 1986 marked 
        the first service conducted by Rev. Taylor as Wesley's minister, although 
        he had assumed the position as of July 1st. The Ottawa Presbytery's service 
        for Rev. Taylor's induction into the Wesley mi1listry was held September 
        28th. Wesley also welcomed his wife, Vina, daughter Jo-Anne and son, Ross. 
        The sermon on the occasion was preached by Rev. Gervis Beecher Black of 
        Parkdale United Church and special music included the first performance 
        of The Lord's House, a vocal duet written by Wesley's Cyril Chapman.4 
        Rev. Taylor was a former police officer with the Nepean Police Service 
        and, with the approval of the Official Board, accepted an invitation to 
        become Nepean's Police Chaplain; a position held concurrently with his 
        Wesley duties. His police experience was found to be of value at Wesley 
        as he was routinely called upon to dispense benevolent funds and food 
        to suppliants seeking help at the church. Whereas the Wesley congregation 
        has always been aware of the plight of the destitute and has contributed 
        much in time and resources to aiding the poor and indigent, it was considered 
        fortunate to have a person who was acquainted with and could (usually) 
        recognize dishonest and fraudulent pan-handlers. This became an even more 
        important consideration when the church instituted a food cupboard in 
        addition to the congregation's regular food donations, an ongoing project 
        begun on November 10, 1985. The new plan involved the sorting of food 
        items into grocery bags to be given to those who ap-proached the church 
        and had no food at home for their next meal. The food cupboard was established 
        in December of 1991 by Laurine Pointen who managed the project.</p>
      <p>Throughout Wesley's history, it is evident that whenever a new minister 
        is welcomed, efforts are made to enhance the work and profile of the church. 
        In Rev. (Bill) Taylor's case, 1986 saw the return (regrettably brief) 
        of a youth group. With Norman Dale as Co-ordinator, the Wesley Young Adults 
        an-nounced purpose was &quot;...to provide a forum where young adults 
        could meet to discuss contemporary is-sues of concern to them in a Christian 
        atmosphere&quot;. The group's first meeting took place October 19, 1986 
        with an attendance of three.5 Nonetheless, a slate of officers was chosen 
        and the group carried on with several functions. A 24 hour dance marathon, 
        November 14-15, netted $225 which was given to the church. Other activities 
        included spaghetti dinners and a pancake supper. The Wesley Young Adults</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 37</b></p>
      <p>conducted the worship service on March 15, 1987, with Norman Dale delivering 
        the address. A planned dinner dance was cancelled on May 22 that year 
        due to lack of support and a further Young Adult service in which Norman 
        Dale once again occupied the pulpit on April 24, 1988 is the last recorded 
        activity of the group.</p>
      <p>The re-establishment of a men's group also occurred in 1986. Led by George 
        McLellan, the men held their first breakfast meeting on November 29,1986. 
        During nine years of unchanging leadership, the group accomplished much, 
        both for the church and for outside organizations. The assets of a functioning 
        men's group in the church were evident immediately in fellowship, fun, 
        worship and goodwill. On a number of occasions, women of the church were 
        invited to share in the breakfast get-togethers. The list of events and 
        activities of the men's group is extensive and includes several sales 
        and entertainment eve-nings. The men sponsored a musical evening with 
        Dominic Darcy, The Singing Policeman&quot; in March of 1986. In tribute 
        to one of its members, Garry Perkins, the group placed 10 Good News Bibles 
        in the pews. During 1987, the men purchased a window air conditioner and 
        installed it in the minister's study. Congregational meeting day luncheons 
        and Easter morning breakfasts were prepared and served by the men and 
        the group joined with the Sunday School in paying for the decorating and 
        refurbishing of a room at Ottawa's Union Mission. An unusual fund raiser 
        was the sale of Canada Savings Bonds. A member of the group held official 
        authority to do so.</p>
      <p>The ladies of the church, who had figured prominently both financially 
        and physically during Wesley's 75th anniversary year, did not let up in 
        their support and activity during the years following. Each of the three 
        Units of the UC.W. have consistently contributed to the welfare of the 
        church as well as to programs directed outside of the church. When deposited 
        into general UC.W. treasury, the money becomes available to the church, 
        where several large sums have annually been given to the General Fund 
        as well as contributions to special projects. (i.e: organ, windows, piano, 
        carpets, etc.) Thousands of dol-lars have been pumped into the church's 
        treasury by the UC.W. through the years. Up until very recently, the congregation 
        appears to have been satisfied with offering no more than seventy-five 
        percent of the church's expenses, depending upon the UC.W. to stave off 
        bankruptcy.6 Additional UC.W. support in 1986 in the form of $1,255 paid 
        for the painting of the kitchen, washrooms, stairwell and hall by Gary 
        Simser and Ray Breton. The UC.W., active as it was, had begun to suffer 
        a decline in membership and in 1986, combined Unit 2 with Unit 1, leaving 
        Units 1 and 3 to constitute the Wesley United Church Women. On March 20th 
        that year in the church hall, Unit 1 sponsored a country music show featuring 
        a group called the Redwing Fiddlers. The same group was brought back a 
        year later by the Wesley Men.</p>
      <p>Wesley's women found a popular respite of sorts from their hard work 
        in their annual shopping trips to US.A Since the mid-seventies, the ladies 
        of the church (and some others) had chartered a bus and travelled to Syracuse, 
        N.Y.7 for weekend get-aways, providing their own tour operators from within 
        their midst. Subsequent legislation gave the touring industry sole operation 
        of such trips, thus preventing the group from running its own tours. The 
        move raised the cost of the excursions and gradually took its toll on 
        the popularity of the event. The last trip was made in November of 1992.</p>
      <p>A change was made to the hour of worship in 1986. Largely as a result 
        of complaints that the traditional 11 O'clock Sunday morning services 
        ended too late for some worshippers to board the local bus to travel home, 
        two congregational votes were taken to determine whether' services should 
        begin at 10:30 a.m. or remain at 11 o'clock. Others liked the idea of 
        the early start already in place during the summer (10:00 a.m.), which 
        left more time for lunch and a long afternoon, and they wished to see 
        the earlier service observed throughout the year. The results of the votes, 
        October 19th and 22nd,</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 38</b></p>
      <p>indicated a majority desire to change to 10:30 a.m.8 The first service 
        at the new time was the Remem-brance Day observance. November 9th.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>XVII</b></p>
      <p>Given as a requirement of the United Church. a new committee was formed 
        in 1987, and it held its first meeting on January 18th. The Ministry. 
        Personnel and Education (M.P.&amp; E.) Committee's responsibilities at 
        its inception at Wesley lay mainly as a liaison between the congregation 
        and minister and officers of the church. The idea was to provide a means 
        for an individual or group finding themselves at odds with the minister 
        or others in the church to privately voice their concerns to the committee, 
        who would investigate and seek m acceptable solution and avoid anger or 
        confrontation among church members. The same avenues were opened for the 
        clergy and staff members. 1</p>
      <p>Each year, one week in November has been designated Canada Music Week. 
        All music chosen for the service on that Sunday is traditionally by Canadian 
        composers. On November 22, 1987. the hymns sung were by Canadian composers 
        and all other music was by Wesley's own Cyril Chapman, who has written 
        a number of hymns and choir anthems for the church. One of those compositions, 
        The First Psalm was sung for the first time by the choir on June 14th 
        of the same year. Chapman music has been played or sung on occasion at 
        Wesley since 1973. It is worthy of note to mention that in 1987, Andy 
        Ha1vorson, who twice filled the office of church treasurer, relinquished 
        that duty after conscientiously serving a total of eighteen years - longest 
        of any before or since. He was presented with a framed scroll from a grateful 
        congregation at the morning service, April 5th.</p>
      <p>1988 was Wesley's 80th anniversary year and an anniversary committee 
        was formed in December of 1987.2 Even before the formation of the committee, 
        Joan Smith volunteered to organize a photo pro-gram. Laurine Pointen agreed 
        to head the committee and arrangements were begun to make 1988 a special 
        year in the life of the church. Two further events of some significance 
        took place in December of 1987. The Committee of Stewards agreed to help 
        the Sunday School pay to redecorate the primary room and change it into 
        a nursery. The committee also placed m organizational mail box, made by 
        Gary Simser. over the lighting dimmer at the rear of the sanctuary and 
        Bill Irvine manufactured and installed security bars on the kitchen cupboards. 
        Hancock Electric was contracted to upgrade the electrical breaker panel 
        in the boiler room and install additional appliance outlets in the kitchen 
        and parlour. The Sunday School purchased carpeting and other items before 
        the year's end Also. on December 29th, a new Yamaha piano, purchased by 
        the U.C.W. at a cost of $4,500. was placed in the sanctuary. It was dedicated 
        to the women of Wesley, pest and present, in recognition of their continuous 
        and dedicated service. During the year, the women also purchased a vacuum 
        cleaner for the church officer.</p>
      <p>The banners used during the 75th Anniversary, reappeared on the wall 
        of the chancel, with the &quot;75&quot; replaced by &quot;80&quot;. Major 
        accomplishments of the 80th anniversary committee included a church photo 
        directory. sale of commemorative plates bearing the picture of Wesley 
        and a brief digest of the church's history, prepared by Cyril Chapman, 
        framed and hung in the narthex. The church also procured forty-six Good 
        News Bibles, the use of which was by now paralleling that of the traditional 
        King James version in church liturgy. They had been purchased in 1987 
        and were stamped and placed in the pews by Marlene Ziemm. More Bibles 
        were presented in memory of Gloucester Deputy Police Chief, William James 
        Nichol Brown at a service of dedication, June 5th. A suggestion that the 
        church hall be given a memorial</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 39</b></p>
      <p>name was briefly considered, but never acted upon. One anniversary event 
        that drew a sizeable gathering was a Hymn-sing, led by Staff Sergeant 
        Garth Hampson, popular soloist with the R.C.M.P. band. Besides solos and 
        congregational singing, the musical evening included an organ and piano 
        duet with Grace Davies, organist and Eleanor Earl, pianist.</p>
      <p>Rev. Taylor's association with the Nepean Police Service allowed him 
        to successfully launch a tradition of annual services to mark what was 
        designated, &quot;Police Appreciation Sunday&quot;. The special Sundays 
        were observed in May of each year, when the size of the congregation was 
        invariably swollen with the addition of many Nepean Police officers, a 
        number of whom participated in the services. The first of these special 
        services was held May 15, 1988 with (then) Deputy Chief Wayne Phillips 
        delivering the message. The service also featured soprano soloist, Const. 
        Lauri Boone singing, &quot;Flying Free&quot;- a song sung several times 
        since by Wesley's choir. Anniversary Sunday, 1988, was observed October 
        30th. Guest preacher on that occasion was Rev. William KT. Wan, M.A, LL.B., 
        M.C.S., M. Div., minister of Ottawa's Chinese United Church and past chair 
        of the Ottawa Presbytery. He also participated in the dedication of a 
        stained glass window: 'The Carpenter's Family&quot;, honouring the memory 
        of the late Agnes and George Chapman and Thomas and Glynn Davies. An anniversary 
        dinner was held November 7th, and a large crowd enjoyed a meal catered 
        by Porteous Caterers of Vernon, Ontario. Invited guests included Rev. 
        and Mrs. Wan and Mr. and Mrs. (Ernie and Linda) Cox, who provided musical 
        entertainment and led the audience in singing. .</p>
      <p>A major expense became necessary in 1988 when it was discovered that 
        wooden frames and other portions of exterior woodwork was beginning to 
        rot and, rather than try to repair and paint the outside of the church, 
        the Trustees and Stewards decided to have the sills, frames fascias and 
        soffits covered with enamelled aluminum. A $12,000 contract was awarded 
        to Shad Construction and a special appeal to the congregation realized 
        a little more than one third of the cost. The difference was made up from 
        the Building Fund and the account promptly paid. In April of 1988, the 
        Committee of Stewards and men of the church spread crushed stone on the 
        parking lot again, and this time created the two parking spaces in front 
        of the minister's study to be used only by the minister and church officer. 
        (No sign was posted)</p>
      <p>The United Church's various Conferences and committees of the General 
        Council had, until 1987, been viewed by many at Wesley as being a distant 
        bureaucracy having little to do with the day-to-day running of the local 
        congregation. However, the report of Wesley's representative to Ottawa 
        Presbytery during that year, George McLellan, drew attention to a subject 
        upon which the church was forced to take a stand and proclaim it to the 
        very top of the United Church hierarchy. The report served to introduce 
        its readers to a number of contentious issues being hotly debated at the 
        Presbytery level. Concern was being expressed by some about the direction 
        the United Church had begun to move, considering the decisions made by 
        General Council regarding such things as capital punishment, free trade, 
        etc. The wisdom of political involvement with many such issues was questioned. 
        3</p>
      <p>Further topics mentioned in later reports included &quot;Inclusive Language&quot;, 
        &quot;The Authority and Interpretation of Scripture&quot; and &quot;Report 
        Toward a Christian Understanding of Sexual Orientation, Lifestyle and 
        Ministry&quot;. The latter subject continued to be the most controversial; 
        the one upon which Wesley made its views known most emphatically. During 
        1988, shortly after the release of that report, the Ministry, Personnel 
        and Education Committee at Wesley conducted a vote among Wesley members 
        to determine the will of the congregation concerning acceptance or rejection 
        of the report. The report generally would allow the ordination of practising 
        homosexuals into the ministry of the United Church of Canada. The result 
        was rejection by 96% of voters. 4 The congregation subsequently expressed 
        agreement with the</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 40</b></p>
      <p>&quot;Declaration of Conviction&quot; of a group called &quot;Community 
        of Concern&quot;, which stated: that '&#133;the Biblical intention for 
        sexual behaviour is loving fidelity for life within marriage and loving 
        celibacy outside marriage &quot;.</p>
      <p><br>
        Contrary to the wishes of the Wesley congregation, the thirty-second General 
        Council of the United Church voted on August 24, 1988 to accept practising 
        homosexual persons for ordination into the ministry of the church. A special 
        meeting of the Official Board was held on the following October 17th to 
        plan Wesley's official reaction to the General Council's decision. On 
        November 6th, the congregation met to vote on whether to join &quot;Community 
        of Concern&quot;. That organization was fighting the decision of General 
        Council with respect to the ordination of homosexuals (and some other 
        changes being implem-ented within the United Church). A motion to accept 
        the Community of Concern's Declaration of Conviction, but to reserve judgement 
        on its Declaration of Intentions until after the formal request for a 
        plebiscite had been made, was carried. 5 A request for a plebiscite involving 
        members of the United Church across Canada was ultimately denied. The 
        furor that had enraged so many people at the time gradually subsided, 
        but other concerns such as inclusive language and revisionism were incrementally 
        introduced, and an accelerated liberalization in theological circles later 
        extended throughout the United Church and began to find its way into the 
        liturgy and functioning at Wesley.</p>
      <p>In November of 1986, the trustees received communication from the City 
        of Ottawa announcing its desire to implement a plan of streetscaping between 
        Clegg Street and Colonel By Drive. The plan involved placing a seat on 
        Wesley's lawn at the bus stop, tree planting and decorative pedestrian 
        lighting. The Board advised the city that it had no objection to the proposed 
        changes. The trustees included a request that the problem of left turning 
        from Main Street into Graham Avenue be addressed, and carried a suggestion 
        that flashing green signals be placed at the intersection of Lees Avenue, 
        Graham Avenue and Main Street. A reply to that letter stated that a flashing 
        light would likely be installed. No such move was ever made and subsequent 
        requests for consideration met with no success, either from the City nor 
        the Region of Ottawa-Carleton. In spite of the poor response, the Board 
        consented on August 16, 1987 to a request of the City that they plant 
        five Honey Locust trees on the church lawn in keeping with the development 
        plan of November, 1986.6</p>
      <p>Records show that during the late 70's and 80's, a recurring item on 
        the Trustees' agenda was, then as now, insurance considerations. It is 
        an important responsibility of the trustees to ensure that suf-ficient 
        coverage be maintained as far as reasonably possible, since the church 
        property is held in trust for the United Church of Canada. Concerns discussed 
        at various meetings included boiler coverage, em-ployee injury compensation, 
        liability to persons using the building, value of building and contents 
        and fire insurance. Changes in insurers were made according to coverage, 
        cost and service provided by repre-sentatives. In 1980, the question of 
        whether or not the boiler and ancillary heating equipment carried specific 
        protection led to inquiries of the church's independent insurance agent, 
        W.H. Scrivens &amp; Son, and a request for a quotation.7 A subsequent 
        reply from the agent assured the Board that the policy in ef-fect covered 
        the boiler and the subject was dropped for the time being.8 The subject 
        returned in 1986. The fact that no inspection of the heating plant by 
        an insurance company had been made, created the sus-picion that no specific 
        coverage was in place and a letter from the insurance agent left the trustees 
        still wondering just exactly what the church could expect in the way of 
        compensation, should a problem occur with the heating plant. The Board 
        requested that specific information from the insurer.9 It was eventual-ly 
        determined that damage to the building resulting from a malfunction of 
        the boiler would be covered, but the equipment itself would not. Measures 
        were therefore taken during 1988 to include optional in-surance coverage 
        on the boiler and machinery - an astute move which was later justified.<br>
