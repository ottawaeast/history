      <p>presented the film as a gift to the church. The actual burning of the 
        mortgage document was described in the Ottawa Journal of October 25, 1962:</p>
      <p>&quot;AH. Halvorson handed the mortgage to G.C. Chapman and the docu-ment 
        was ignited by Robert Carson, the church's oldest member. The ashes were 
        caught in a tray held by R.AL. Hill and Peter Sinclair.&quot;</p>
      <p>The renowned Women's Association, in its usual competent fashion, made 
        plans for the opening dinner well in advance of the affair. The decision 
        was made at its' meeting of October 26, 1953 to order 225 sets of dishes 
        and to prepare for five hundred settings. The price of tickets was set 
        at $1.50 per adult and fifty cents for children. 2 The date for the dinner 
        was tentatively set for March 3, 1954 but was changed to March 5th when 
        it was discovered that the earlier date was Ash Wednesday. The first sitting 
        was arranged for 5:30 p.m. and six hundred adult and several children's 
        tickets were printed. The quality of the dinner was in keeping with the 
        traditional reputation of meals prepared by Wesley's ladies. Accounts 
        of the opening dinner include the menu...</p>
      <p>tomato juice apple pie and ice cream<br>
        turkey tea, coffee, milk<br>
        potatoes rolls and butter<br>
        turnips radishes, celery, pickles<br>
        gravy cranberry sauce and salads</p>
      <p><br>
        ...and the whole operation was under the general supervision of Mrs. J. 
        C. Robinson, the association's president. . Other churches obligingly 
        loaned utensils, glassware and dishes for the occasion and Morrison-Lamothe 
        Bakery offered to cook the turkeys. Flowers were donated by a number of 
        local florists. The ladies' shopping list of groceries secured in preparation 
        of the event included:</p>
      <p>4 bags potatoes<br>
        4 gallons milk<br>
        2 gallons cream<br>
        2 pounds tea<br>
        25 pounds sugar<br>
        10 pounds cube sugar 7 pounds flour<br>
        20 pounds butter</p>
      <p>1 pound powdered savory 10 pounds salt<br>
        1 pound pepper<br>
        1 dozen eggs<br>
        5 bunches celery<br>
        3 boxes Dreft dishwashing powder<br>
        2 boxes Ajax cleanser</p>
      <p>Approximately six hundred diners were served during three sittings. Those 
        awaiting their turn at the dinner table were entertained in the church 
        sanctuary by the organist, William Keizer joined by a vocal soloist and 
        a trumpeter.</p>
      <p>Wesley's opening dinner of 1954 was as successful as its first in 1909. 
        This time, donations of one thousand dollars to the Building Fund and 
        $300. for the General Fund were realized and duly turned over to the church 
        by the Women's Association.</p>

      <p>During the fund raising, building and opening of the new Wesley Church. 
        the congregation enjoyed a fellowship and shared a will to achieve rarely 
        seen within the church since the erection of the first building forty-five 
        years earlier. At that time, the Ottawa Methodist Social Union was instrumental 
        in the realization of the building. This time, the people of Wesley, their 
        friends and committees built the church and, for several years thereafter, 
        made Wesley an important part of their everdyday lives. Two services each 
        week, a flourishing Sunday School and mid-week activities attracted a 
        loyal congregation. Or-ganizations functioning at the time included the 
        Women's Association, Woman's Missionary Society, Onward Mission Band, 
        C.G.I.T., Explorers, Tuxis and Trail Rangers, Couples' and Young Adult 
        Clubs and an impressive Men's Association-product of the several groups 
        and committees who worked together during the canvassing for funds and 
        building of the church. Their several endeavors created a busy church 
        family whose grateful members availed themselves of their handsome new 
        building. In March of 1954, another group was added to the activities 
        at Wesley when Miss Ethel Dempsey (Mrs. John Ogilvy) was granted Session 
        approval to use the hall for Boy Scout meetings. Miss Dempsey was leader 
        of the 19th Ottawa Troop.</p>
      <p>&quot;The new church was in use for only a short time when an unfortunate 
        situation arose. The choir, under the direction of Col. McRory, with William 
        Keizer as organist, was a splendid assembly of singers. Long hours of 
        rehearsal were spent prior to the first services in the new church so 
        that music befitting the opening could be presented. The music was eminently 
        pleasing and the Session was quick to formally thank the two men for their 
        work. 1 The choir was a large one and therein lay the problem. In the 
        old church, should more seating be required to accommodate the choir, 
        it was a simple matter to place addi-tional chairs on the platform. The 
        new church was designed with a chancel choir however, in which the choir 
        is divided into two groups facing each other from either side. The ideal 
        situation would have the sopranos and altos on one side with the tenors 
        and basses on the other, beside the organ console. The choir completely 
        filled both sides of the chancel and its size forced the altos to spill 
        onto the sedilia. (the pew behind the Communion table). With space thus 
        limited behind the table, it would be necessary for those people to move 
        out to allow the minister and elders to dispense Communion - not a happy 
        situation and not one that appealed to the altos nor the director. The 
        choir directors suggestion that the Communion table be moved forward was 
        not acceptable to the minister, due to its having been consecrated in 
        the position it held and relocating it would, as pointed out in an explanatory 
        talk on the significance of the Communion table in the Protestant Church, 
        be tantamount to sacrilege.2 The director then requested of the Session 
        that the problem be addressed and when the Session's Music Committee suggested 
        that the men of the choir be seated where the altos were, he saw that 
        plan as no solution and he tendered his resignation. 3 The choir immediately 
        became reduced in size and overcrowding has never been a problem since. 
        Numbers remained respectable, however, until a few years later, when it 
        became too small to use both sides of the chancel and of the few newcomers 
        that took their place in the choir, none stayed for more than a short 
        time. In contrast to the shrinking of the choir, the Session arid Committee 
        of Stewards moved to increase their numbers arid the congregation grew 
        to the point that when Rev. Love retired in 1958, membership in the church 
        had more than doubled what it had been in 1952.4</p>
      <p>The church's interior lent itself to the discrete placement of memorial 
        plaques and small items presented to the church in memory of past members. 
        At the tront of the nave, at either side of the chancel, were mounted 
        the church's two honour rolls; on the left, those who served in the armed 
        forces during</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 23</b></p>
      <p>the first world war and those of the second world war, on the right. 
        The hope expressed by Robert Carson in his early writings was fulfilled, 
        i.e.:</p>
      <p>&quot;The names inscribed in the honour roll 1914 to 1918 (lately relegated 
        to the rear of the church) will, we trust, find a place of honour in the 
        new church. &quot;</p>
      <p>The north and south walls were lined with windows simply begging to be 
        transformed into stained glass art. Such was the prospect of receiving 
        fmancial gifts to be used in memorials to departed Wesleyans, that the 
        Quarterly Official Board on June 23, 1954, decided to form a Memorial 
        Committee. T.A Clark was named chairman of that committee, 5 and whether 
        that first committee became defunct is not clear, but on January 11, 1956, 
        the same motion was passed by the Official Board and another Memorial 
        Committee was set up under the chairmanship of George Chapman with representatives 
        from the Session, Stewards, Trustees, Women's Association, Woman's Missionary 
        Society and Sunday School. They agreed that every window in the north 
        and south walls of the sanctuary should eventually be converted to stained 
        glass memorials - the north windows depicting Old Testament subjects and 
        the south windows, New Testament. The first stained glass window to be 
        installed was offered by Gertrude Emond in memory of her late husband, 
        Frederick, killed on the field of battle in 1918. An active worker in 
        the church and long time teacher of the Sunday School's Primary Department, 
        Mrs. Emond was the first person in Wesley ever to be enrolled in the Volunteer 
        Workers' Fellowship of the United Church of Canada - the recommendation 
        of the Session in view of her long and faithful work in the Sunday School. 
        6 The window appropriately depicts the Master holding a small child with 
        the admonition: &quot;Suffer the little children to come unto me...&quot;</p>
      <p align="center"><b>XI</b></p>
      <p>In 1955, the house beside the old church, owned by Mrs. Holtz, became 
        available for lease and Wesley chose to rent it for a manse at $115 per 
        month. The church agreed to make minor repairs and the men of the congregation 
        painted the rooms of the manse and tiled the kitchen floor. The house 
        served as home for the Love family until Rev. Love's retirement in 1958 
        and for his successor's family until 1964. At that time, a house at 18 
        Burnham Road was purchased at a cost of $16,500. The money to buy the 
        house was raised through a mortgage which was paid in full by 1969. The 
        United Church Women (U.C.W.), the former Women's Association, made handsome 
        contributions toward the discharge of the mortgage. <font size="1">1</font></p>
      <p>The move into the new church left an empty building whose future had 
        to be decided. It was of little use to anyone in its present condition 
        and to renovate the old church to be used as a hall or functional centre 
        of any kind would cost money that the congregation simply did not have. 
        In addition, should the building be improved for anything other than a 
        place of worship, the property would be taxed accordingly. An interim 
        solution was found when the Ottawa Grand Opera Company was given permission 
        to store stage scenery and properties in the building. The company bestowed 
        conservative financial gifts upon the Trustees from time to time which 
        were placed in a special account at the Bank of Nova Scotia. The account 
        was to be drawn upon to pay any expenses necessary in the minimal maintenance 
        of Wesley's first church which had now become a large storage shed.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 24</b></p>
      <p>The arrangement lasted until July of 1963 when a tender was accepted 
        from Noel Lepage Construction in the amount of $850. for the demolition 
        of the old church.2 Although congregational approval had been granted 
        in 1960 for demolition, it was the report of the fire inspector in declaring 
        the structure a fire hazard and recommending its repair or removal, that 
        ultimately brought about its demise. 3 By the fall of 1963, a vacant lot 
        marked the site of Ottawa East's 1909 Methodist church. It became by convenience, 
        rather than by official designation, an area for the parking of vehicles.</p>
      <p>In the long list of clergy and laity who have served Wesley, it is seen 
        that even though some terms were of limited duration, all were dedicated 
        and showed a desire to see Wesley survive and flourish and its successive 
        congregations maintain a dynamic presence in Ottawa East. With due regard 
        and respect to all of our church's clergy, it could be said that two of 
        the most outstanding ministers at Wesley served during what was arguably 
        the most critical period in the church's history up to that time. They 
        were the Rev. A. J. Love, who led a small, determined congregation into 
        a new church, and the minister following him: the Rev. Dr. H.W. Pointen. 
        Dr. Pointen's genuine desire to see Wesley remain strong and influence 
        an ever increasing number of people, held together the largest congregation 
        Wesley Church has known. He served Wesley for eleven years, the longest 
        active ministry of anyone before or since. To speculate upon how long 
        he might have remained active in Wesley's pulpit is of little consequence 
        since during the summer of 1969, just a few hours after one of his characteristic 
        visits with an ailing church member, death suddenly and without warning, 
        took him from his congregation. A memorial plaque presented to his memory 
        by the UC.W. hangs on the north wall of the nave, where it was dedicated 
        April 9, 1972. In addition, a stained glass window and a library recall 
        his ministry at Wesley.</p>
      <p>Among the activities prevalent at Wesley during the fifties and sixties 
        were the young people's groups. Aside from the continuing work with the 
        Sunday School, thought was given on many occasions to the organization 
        of boys' and girls' midweek activities. Indeed, so frequently is mention 
        made in Session records of the establishment of such organizations, it 
        is difficult to follow the actual tenure of each. In 1947, T.A Clark had 
        organized a Tuxis and Trail Ranger group and mention has already been 
        made of the Wesley Boys' Choir. A Junior Choir was formed some time later 
        (c. 1962) and under the direction Tom Davies, practised prior to Sunday 
        morning services with Mrs. Ethel Dale assisting at the organ.4 In May 
        of 1953, Session approval was granted Mr. Parker Smith to form a Wolf 
        Cub Pack and to use the church hall for a Den. In November of the same 
        year, he was also given Session support in organizing a boys' group using 
        material to be obtained from the Ontario Boys' Work Board headquarters. 
        Through following years, continuing efforts were made to maintain boys' 
        activities under various leaders. including L.T. Day, Glynn Davies, James 
        MacFarlane, Cedric Dale, Eric McFee and others. However, it became increasingly 
        difficult to carry on boys' work in the church as interest waned in the 
        sixties; not only at junior levels, but throughout the congregation as 
        a whole. During the summer of 1961, Glynn Davies arranged with Rideau 
        Park United Church to have a small group of boys from Wesley join with 
        theirs in regular activities. Wesley would be required to supply transportation 
        to Rideau Park once a week. Mr. Davies' canvass of church members in the 
        form of a questionnaire concerning boys' work yielded disappointment when 
        only two replies were received. The following year, James MacFarlane sought 
        help from the Session in programming and expanding the activities of his 
        Tyro group, led by Brain Park and Allan Smith. </p>
      <p>In January of 1960 a Young People's Union was organized to replace one 
        which had become defunct. It existed as such for one year and then was 
        reorganized as the Wesley Young Adult Club, a name thought to be more 
        descriptive of its membership. The club's activities included Bible study, 
        a short devotional period at each meeting and various social events, including 
        week-end camping trips. Probably the most visible contribution made to 
        the church by the group was the publishing of a monthly church</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 25</b></p>
      <p>magazine called The Wesley Informer. Its pages contained organizational 
        news, announcements, edito-rial comment and items of interest to Wesley's 
        congregation. Publication ceased when the club broke up in January of 
        1963. Its financial balance of $123.48 was given to the church treasurer 
        to be used toward the cost of a drape or panelling currently being considered 
        to be placed at the front of the sanctuary. 5</p>
      <p>The Sunday School carried through the turmoil of the many groups forming 
        and dissolving with a membership in excess of one hundred and an average 
        attendance of between 70 and 90. During 1957 and 1958, a Young Worshippers' 
        League was promoted under the management of Andy Halvorson and the direction 
        and leadership of Glynn Davies. Sunday School pupils (and others) between 
        the ages of eight and sixteen years were encouraged to attend regular 
        Sunday worship services. Those attending with a regularity of 85% or better, 
        were awarded pins and certificates-not to be confused with the Robert 
        Raikes system of diplomas and seals. awarded for regular Sunday School 
        attendance. The apparent Session interest in having more young people 
        attend Sunday services no doubt stemmed from a realization that church 
        attendance in general was gradually falling off, so much so that on September 
        27, 1955 - less than two years after the opening of the present church 
        building-the Session had discontinued the Sunday evening services: &quot;...until 
        such time as the Session decides attendance is likely to be high enough 
        to warrant resumption&quot;.</p>
      <p>Girls' work at the opening of the present church building and through 
        subsequent years, while not constant, did not seem to face the crises 
        encountered by the several boys' groups-prompting the many references 
        made to boys' work in the Session's records. The Explorers and Canadian 
        Girls In Training (G.G.I.T.) existed at times concurrently and at other 
        times, either one or the other, depending upon the availability of girls 
        of suitable age. As in the case of boys' work, certain church members 
        displayed a dedicated interest in leading the groups from time to time. 
        Names prominent in that regard are: Irene Bennett, Dorothy Wallace, Jean 
        Duncan (Hopkins), Evelyn Bourne and Beryl Gregory. Several others are 
        to be found in the organizational lists following this narrative history. 
        1973 saw the last year of operation of the Explorers and the disappearance 
        of all youth and young people's activities at Wesley, with the steadfast 
        exception of the Sunday School. 6</p>
      <p>As in the case of the first church many years earlier. Men's Associations 
        came and went but much work was performed about the church within or without 
        formal organization. Names like William Irvine, Robert McQuattie, Cedric 
        Dale, Andy Halvorson. James and Erwin MacFarlane and many others appear 
        in records of work done to or at the church by men. The skills of such 
        tradesmen as George and Cyril Chapman, Parker Smith, Noel Lepage and Tom 
        Davies have over the years been used to advantage for the church. It is 
        perhaps unfair to mention some and not all who have contributed their 
        time and effort in this way, but just as it is so obviously impossible 
        to identify everyone who has aided in one way or another, so it would 
        seem equally unjust to purposely overlook mention of those who so regularly 
        and prominently made themselves available for such service. In truth. 
        most of the members of the various boards in recent years, as in times 
        past, have given a helping hand in performing volunteer projects ranging 
        from hedge trimming (the Men's Association originally planted a Chinese 
        Elm hedge that bordered the lawns) and grounds maintenance to carpentty, 
        electrical sad heating plant repair, installation of protective panes 
        over the memorial windows, painting, carpeting and tiling and other sometimes 
        menial tasks. not so readi-ly apparent to the casual observer. The Sunday 
        School chalk and tackboard system in the church hall, however, was designed 
        and the installation supervised by a woman: Ann Elizabeth Hill.<br>
