        The use of the church building and facilities by persons or groups from 
        outside of the church became a concern in 1988,10 when the trustees were 
        advised by the insurance agent that such groups should be required to 
        carry liability insurance, indemnifying the trustees and other officers 
        and members of the church. Up until that time, various groups approved 
        by the Session had invariably been allowed the use of parts of the building 
        with apparently no thought of protection in the case of Wesley's being 
        named in a legal action brought by someone as a result of the activity 
        of the group. Other companies agreed that over the years, it had become 
        more and more evident that such coverage could well be required. The trustees 
        drew up a tentative list of responsibilities expected of those using church 
        facilities. It included the requirement of an insurance policy and later 
        formed a standard condition contained in applications from outside interests.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>XVIII</b></p>
      <p>From time to time, the church suffered break-ins; an attempt was made 
        September 17, 1988. Ac-tual thefts have been very light, since the building 
        does not house currency nor documents of value to anyone other than the 
        church itself. Damage has been limited to broken windows or jimmied locks-and 
        that to little avail. However, the cost of repairs and the suggestion 
        of the police that security lights be installed on the north side of the 
        building moved the trustees to have lights installed in that area by Hancock 
        Electric at the end of January, 1989. Motion controlled flood lights were 
        installed on the south side of the building in June of 1994.1 Before leaving 
        the activities of 1989, it is worthy to note that the U. C. W. once again 
        put their funds to work for the church when they replaced the existing 
        rose coloured cloth on the chancel wall with the present rich red drapery. 
        It was installed on May 16th by David Davies, Gary Simser and others.</p>
      <p>In 1990, the &quot;Report Towards A Christian Understanding of Sexual 
        Orientation, Lifestyle and Ministry&quot; was still a hotly debated issue 
        within the courts of the church. As well, the National Church found itself 
        discussing such matters as the departure of several dozen ministers to 
        other denominations, the authority of Scripture, a declining membership 
        and a falling off of weekly attendance. The affirmation of the General 
        Council's stand at its 33rd assembly on August 21st concerning these subjects 
        did little to encourage the Wesley congregation.2 Nonetheless, Wesley's 
        spirit of devotion to inherent Christian beliefs and loyalties at the 
        local level, meant that few members left to go elsewhere. Although the 
        congregation was not about to leave the United Church, there remained 
        a somewhat diminished confidence in the deliberations of General Council.</p>
      <p>In August of 1991, the church lost a humane and valuable worker in the 
        person of Evelyn Merrifield. Her husband, Leonard, was secretary of the 
        trustee board at the time, becoming chairman in November. It was at the 
        trustees, meeting of December 1, 1991, that he announced his desire to 
        set up a fund to be called &quot;The Evelyn Thelma Merrifield Memorial 
        Fund&quot;, in honour of his late wife. Since it involved an initial contribution 
        of notable size, it was considered an asset of the church and the terms 
        of its implementation and maintenance were placed before the Board of 
        Trustees for consideration and ac-ceptance of responsibility for administration 
        of the fund. The trustees accepted the terms of an agreement with the 
        principal contributor, Leonard Merrifield, and the fund was set up with 
        a capitalization of $7,634.84 on December 6, 1991, with a further $5,000 
        deposited January 2, 1992. The trustees' investment continues to provide 
        welcome contributions to the church's Benevolent Fund. 3</p>
      <p align="center"><br>
        <b>Page 42</b></p>
      <p>January of 1992 also saw the reappearance of &quot;Wesley Wisdom&quot;, 
        the church's monthly newsletter. It was re-established by Cyril Chapman 
        after some years of absence following a failed earlier attempt by Wayne 
        Pointen and Joan Smith to provide a newsletter.4 The same name was used 
        and therefore the January, 1992 issue was designated &quot;volume 2. number 
        1 &quot;. Wayne Pointen initially photocopied and distributed the newsletter.</p>
      <p>As a means of augmenting church funds. the idea of instituting a Memorial 
        Book was suggested by Martin Pelton at the January 26, 1992 Congregational 
        Meeting. The suggestion was adopted and the Memorial Committee was given 
        the responsibility of implementing the plan. In return for donations given 
        to the church in honour or memory of someone. that person's name would 
        be inscribed in the book, (by Leslie Smith), which would be displayed 
        in the sanctuary each Sunday. Ariel and Alex Hancock donated a decorated 
        book for the purpose and Leonard Merrifield built an ornate stand which 
        he donated in memory of his wife, Evelyn. 5</p>
      <p>A busy schedule in May of 1992 prevented the observance of Police Appreciation 
        Sunday. The May 3rd service was conducted by the Independent Order of 
        Odd Fellows, Ottawa District #55 and Rebekah Lodge, #34. Tim Carrigan, 
        who has conducted several services in the absence of the minister and 
        during Christmas Eve and Easter sunrise services. conducted the May 24th 
        service. The minister and clerk of Session were attending the sessions 
        of the United Church's Montreal &amp; Ottawa Conference. Wesley was not 
        entirely deprived of a police presence during 1992, however. Early in 
        June, Rev. Taylor entered hospital for surgery which would keep him inactive 
        throughout most of June and July and mem-bers of the Fellowship of Christian 
        Peace Officers and Nepean and Ottawa Police Services joined the Wesley 
        congregation and conducted the service on June 14th. The minister's daughter. 
        Jo-Anne Taylor and Martin Pelton filled in until the July closing.</p>
      <p>May 2, 1993 saw the last Police Appreciation Day observed at Wesley, 
        as one week later, the congregation, for the second time in the church's 
        history, lost its minister through sudden tragic death. The news awaited 
        worshippers as they arrived at the church for the regular service, May 
        9th - a bright and pleasant spring morning. That Sunday was to have featured 
        a guest preacher from the Bible Society. Mr. W.G. Wight. speaking at the 
        invitation of the U.C.W. He was introduced by Laurine Pointen and spoke 
        briefly with a message of condolence to a shocked congregation.6 Rev. 
        Taylor's funeral service was held at the church May 12th and included 
        an honour guard of members of the Nepean Police Service. A memorial plaque. 
        mounted on the north wall of the sanctuary beside that of the late Rev. 
        Dr. H W. Pointen (1969), was dedicated April 23, 1995 during an impressive 
        ceremony.7 Rev. (Bill) Taylor had been a very active pastor, greatly appreciated 
        by the congregation and his passing was keenly felt.</p>
      <p>The first move toward replacing Rev. Taylor was made on June 20. 1993 
        when the Rev. Stewart Hewlett conducted the worship service and remained 
        for a meeting of the congregation in which he ex-plained the first steps 
        to take in securing a new pastor. This involved the formation of a Pastoral 
        Relations Committee, who would be given the task of choosing an appropriate 
        candidate. The committee was elected by the congregation numbering forty-five 
        persons at the same meeting.8 After a lengthy and involved period of application 
        by the committee, including a formal written survey of the congregation 
        on a wide ranging number of aspects concerning attitudes and expectations 
        of the church population, the com-mittee made its recommendation on Palm 
        Sunday. March 27. 1994. In the presence of Presbytery repre-sentatives 
        Doug Powel and Rev. Christine Gross, Pastoral Relations Committee chairman 
        Paul Johnston announced the committee recommendation that Karen Niven-Wigston, 
        a diaconal minister who had recently served temporarily at Rideau Park 
        and Kanata United Churches, be called to serve full time at</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 43</b></p>
      <p>Wesley.9 She originally came to Ottawa from St. John's United Church 
        in Georgetown, Ontario, where she was the minister of Christian Education. 
        The congregation accepted the recommendation and Karen Niven-Wigston became 
        Wesley's first full-time woman minister on July 1, 1994. At the same time, 
        the Presbytery was asked to seek permission of the Montreal-Ottawa Conference 
        that she continue to be permitted to preside at the sacraments. This was 
        granted for as long as she remains pastor at Wesley. 10</p>
      <p>An interesting issue arose during the time that the Pastoral Relations 
        Committee and congregation were wrestling with the requirements of the 
        United Church in seeking a minister. An apparently erroneous report was 
        received by Presbytery that Wesley and Eastbrook were interested in possibly 
        joining in a 2-point pastoral charge arrangement, sharing a common minister. 
        Since the Wesley congregation had heard nothing of such a suggestion, 
        it was a curious Wesley crowd that turned out to a meeting, called and 
        conducted by Presbytery representatives, held jointly with the Eastbrook 
        congregation. Those present soon learned that Presbytery was under the 
        misapprehension that the Eastbrook and Wesley congregations had met and 
        were interested in pursuing the possibility. Such was not the case and 
        con-trary to the initial belief of some, Eastbrook United had not approached 
        Wesley hat-in-hand for help, but had merely wondered if Wesley might see 
        such an arrangement as helpful in affording a pastoral replacement. 11</p>
      <p>By 1994, the term &quot;installation&quot; to describe the official placement 
        of a minister into a pastoral charge had been changed to &quot;covenanting&quot;, 
        and the covenanting service for Karen Niven-Wigston was held at Wesley 
        on September 25th of that year. The service was a revelation to the Wesley 
        congregation of how the church was changing in terms of liturgy and worship 
        when for the first time, a liturgical dance began a service unlike any 
        former induction of a Wesley minister. The ceremony was highly symbolic 
        in nature. Several congregation members presented articles representing 
        the various facets of the church's Christian responsibilities, and the 
        commitment of the pastor and congregation to each other. The dance was 
        performed by Ruth Richardson and Wendy Morrell, who swept along the centre 
        aisle to the chancel while a tape player sounded: &quot;Holy Spirit, Thou 
        Art Welcome in This Place&quot;. Presiding officer of the service was 
        Rev. Shawn Ketcheson, B.Sc., M.Div., chair of Presbytery. The Rev. Grant 
        Dillenbeck, B.A, M.Div.; STM, was the worship leadgr and the Meditation 
        was delivered by Rev. Christing Gross; RA; M.Div., Th.M. Symbolic gifts, 
        given to the new minister who placed them on the Communion table, included 
        a Bible (Martin Pelton), a pitcher of water (David Lashley) that the minister 
        poured into the font; a towel and basin (Ruth Foster, Adam Worth and George 
        McLellan), and a loaf of bread and cup of wine (Paul Johnston and Lorna 
        Baldwin). Music during the service included a flute quartet made up of 
        stu-dents, Meriam Tadolsky, Patrick Manhire, Hilary Myron and Amy Charlton. 
        St. Paul's Eastern's Ashley Dent played a violin solo accompanied by Pat 
        Girard and the choir, joined by many members of the Kanata United Church 
        choir, sang the anthem, &quot;Go Into the World&quot;, requested by pastor 
        Niven-Wigston.</p>
      <p>During the period in which the Wesley congregation was somewhat preoccupied 
        with welcoming a new minister, some other things were happening around 
        the church. The chronic shortfall of weekly offerings versus church expenses 
        was again voiced at the congregational meeting of January 31, 1993. Church 
        treasurer; Debbie Orth-Lashley; stated that monthly offrings were invariably 
        $1,000 short of church expenses. The perennial input of large sums of 
        money by the UC.W. could not be counted upon to continue with the aging 
        and retirement of many of its members, and newcomers were few. With the 
        untimely death of its minister during the year, the church received a 
        sizeable insurance payment and the U. C. W. was not asked for money that 
        year, but the insurance money all but disappeared by the end of the year 
        due to the constant monthly deficit. Items like boiler repairs, surveyor's 
        fees, carpeting and reroofIng</p>
      <p align="center"><br>
        <b>Page 44</b></p>
      <p>the main body of the church all took their toll fmancially.12 So, the 
        quest for increased offerings remains a continuing characteristic of the 
        church.</p>
      <p>Wesley and its organizations have always been vitally concerned and interested 
        in the welfare of those in need. In that regard, the U. C. W. has consistently 
        used its financial resources to support many charitable organizations 
        and social programs. In the same spirit, the men's groups, when possible, 
        have done the same. The Sunday School initiated a program called &quot;Children 
        Helping Children&quot; in which money raised from teas, sales and special 
        services is used to provide help for other children through its support 
        of specific missions and includes hampers of food, clothing and toys for 
        the needy at Christmas time. The arrival of Karen Niven- Wigston gave 
        Wesley a pastor dedicated to the furtherance of such benevolence, a concept 
        of change and an intense desire to raise Wesley's profile through community 
        out-reach.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>XIX</b></p>
      <p>In keeping with most pastors entering a new charge, Karen Niven-Wigston 
        introduced some new and different aspects to the regular liturgy. She 
        called upon her previous association with other con-gregations and contacts 
        to invite guest groups and individuals to enrich worship services. 1 She 
        encouraged members of the congregation to participate in various aspects 
        of the worship service and included new (lawfully) photocopied contemporary 
        hymns.2 Many of her services included dramatic readings, interviews and 
        special presentations as alternatives to the traditional sermon and the 
        King James Bible gradually fell into total disuse in favour of the Good 
        News version, and others. She supported common interests with other local 
        churches like ecumenical outdoor Palm Sunday services with Canadian Martyrs 
        and Church of the Ascension, seniors luncheons with Canadian Martyrs and 
        an unsuccessful attempt was made to initiate a seniors' drop-in centre 
        at the church. A group made up of volunteers from the local congregations 
        began meeting regularly with visible minority immigrants to converse and 
        socialize as a means of easing their transition to Canadian language and 
        customs. One unexpected innovation to a regular Sunday morning service 
        occurred on January 16, 1994, when sometime during a cold week-end, with 
        temperatures ranging around -30 C, the heating plant failed and worship 
        had to be cancelled.3 The boiler and machinery clause in the church's 
        insurance policy covered most of the cost to repair the resulting damage 
        and State Farm Insurance finally paid the church the sum of $2,831.58 
        a year later.</p>
      <p>On January 1, 1994, Wesley became a contributing member of an organization 
        known as the Centretown Churches Social Action Committee, a group supplying 
        benevolent support to local groups and individuals. Our initial representatives 
        to that group were Ann Howe and Marilyn Peacock. With the death of our 
        former pastor, the practice of dispensing money and food directly from 
        the church was discontinued and the Official Board decided to financially 
        support the C.C.S.AC., while continuing to provide nonperishable food 
        to the Emergency Food Centre.4 In keeping with her desire to make use 
        of the church building and facilities as widely as possible in response 
        to requests from charitable groups and individuals, the minister sought 
        approval of the Official Board to allow an organization named, &quot;Chil-dren's 
        Creative Response to Conflict&quot; to use various sections of the building 
        The Board concurred and an agreement was drawn up.5 However, after discussions 
        with the principals of the group, it was decided that its unusual and 
        extensive requirements in time and space would interfere with the regular 
        congrega-tional use of the church and no agreement was reached. Another 
        proposal by Karen Niven-Wigston, however, that Wesley run a &quot;Collective 
        Kitchen&quot; program was inaugurated and was conducted by Laurine Pointen.6 
        The minister presided over Bible study and discussion groups and on May 
        7, 1995, initiated a women's organization that they named &quot;Bamboo&quot;: 
        a women's &quot;Spirituality and Social Action&quot; group.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 45</b></p>
      <p>There was also an announcement that Laurine and Wayne Pointen wished 
        to aid in the financing of con-tinuing education at appropriate institutions 
        such as Stewart House Resource Centre and the Ottawa Lay School of Theology, 
        for those who might require it. Each case would be handled individually 
        and at the discretion of the minister and Session.7 In mentioning the 
        Session, it is interesting to note that at its meeting of December 6, 
        1994, it was decided to end the long-time traditional practice of having 
        the church's elders visit members before an upcoming communion service 
        and distribute cards which were placed on the offering plate during the 
        service. The cards were then collected by the Session and used to determine 
        who were not in attendance and, following a given number of abstentions, 
        the member would be contacted to see if there was a problem. 8 The telephone 
        has replaced the routine pre-Communion vis-itation. In the Fall of 1994, 
        four elders and the choir director and Sunday school secretary made up 
        a new worship committee meeting monthly to plan and introduce innovations 
        to the agenda, ritual and mu-sic of the church's worship services. It 
        was later expanded to include additional members from the con-gregation.</p>
      <p>On November 26, 1995, the Committee of Stewards, in an attempt to augment 
        lagging weekly offerings, entered the field of entertainment when it presented 
        a concert entitled &quot;The Classics Revisited&quot;. The concert of 
        classical music featured mainly local Wesley performers, with Debbie Orth-Lashley 
        as compere. Taking part were Candice Bernes, Patrick Manhire, Grace Davies, 
        Linda Smith, Cyril Chap-man, Jessica Alfoldi, Karen Johnson. Patricia 
        Truemner, Jasmine Kelly and Joy, Marma and Kim Vidal. The Stewards also 
        sponsored an informal talent show on May 5, 1996. That concert, also by 
        local performers, was preceded by a hot-dog and chilli supper and presentation 
        of a musical, &quot;Ok Jonah&quot;, per-formed by youth of Kanata United 
        Church and a few Wesley members. The show included performances by members 
        of the Woods Manufacturing Co. brass band, directed by David Bruce. Wesley 
        performers were Grace Davies, Ruth Foster, David Lashley, Linda Smith, 
        Cyril Chapman, Patrick Manhire and Jack Ross.</p>
      <p>In January of 1996, a project was launched to adopt a Mission Statement 
        for Wesley. The procedure, following guidelines devised by the United 
        Church's national office, began with the distribution of three assignments 
        in the form of questionnaires (answers to be personal and unpublished), 
        which mem-bers of the congregation were asked to complete by the February 
        4th annual congregational meeting.9 That meeting included the first of 
        three workshops designed to arrive at a representative Mission State-ment. 
        The chosen wording of the resulting document was announced on Easter Sunday, 
        April 7, 1996. It read:</p>
      <p>'To serve God by ministering to the spiritual and practical needs of 
        the people, both in our church and in the greater community in a changing 
        environment&quot;</p>
      <p><br>
        One of the many requests received by the minister from outside groups 
        wishing to use the Wesley building came from a group of women in 1995, 
        who had formed a collective called The Women's Cloth-ing Exchange. On 
        December 4, 1995, representatives from the Committee of Stewards, Board 
        of Trustees and the minister met with a member of the collective to discuss 
        the possibility of its using the church for its operation. The expressed 
        purpose of the organization was to lend suitable clothing to women seeking 
        employment, who were financially unable to dress appropriately for job 
        interviews. Tentative agreement for the use of designated portions of 
        the church on an ongoing basis was reached and the trustees accepted a
