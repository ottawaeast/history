    <td colspan="2">The first decade of the Twentieth Century brought a flurry 
      of church building in Ottawa East. With village incorporation in 1888 there 
      was a sense of separateness felt by the various denominations living on 
      that 'slice of land' between the canal and river and they wanted their own 
      congregations. By 1901 the village population had reached approximately 
      1,500 souls and almost everyone in the census of that year listed a religious 
      persuasion, yet there was only one church. 
      <p><a href="../Ascension/Ascension_Page_One.htm">Trinity Church (later Church 
        of the Ascension)</a> had been built in 1877 at the corner of Main and 
        Echo to serve the Anglicans and for nearly two decades had also been the 
        church of other Christians. By 1901 the Catholic population of Ottawa 
        East was large enough to require a separate parish. The bilingual parish 
        of Holy Family came into existence that year under the direction of the 
        Oblates and <a href="../SteFamille/SteFamille_Page_One.htm">Ste. Famille 
        Church</a> was built on what is now Oblate Avenue. The large German community, 
        was served by <a href="../../History/Germans/Ottawa_East_Germans.htm">St. 
        Paul's Lutheran Church</a> built in 1875 at Wilbrod and King St. (later 
        King Edward). The <a href="../Calvary%20Baptist/Calvary_Baptist_index.htm">Baptists</a> 
        held their first meeting in a tent at the corner of Main and Hawthorne 
        in 1908 and later built the present-day church at Main and Evelyn. There 
        was a <a href="../../Image%20Library/Buildings/Churches/PA132227_Church_Congregational_FourthSt_1897.jpg">Congregationalist 
        Church</a> on Fourth St. (Havelock) in 1897 as evidenced by a James Ballantyne 
        photograph but no records have been found as yet.</p>
      <p>The Methodists, up to that point, had endured the long walk over the 
        swing bridge to McLeod Church on Bank St. or the Dominion Church uptown 
        at Queen and Metcalfe. <a href="../../Image%20Library/Buildings/Churches/X_Wesley_1918.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/Buildings/Churches/sm/X_Wesley_1918%20sm.jpg" width="200" height="197" align="right" alt="Wesley Methodist Church - 1918" vspace="4" hspace="4" border="0"></a>Partly 
        to avoid the long journey to a place of worship (especially difficult 
        for children) but also to have a church of their own, forty Methodist 
        from Ottawa East met in late 1908 to begin the process of establishing 
        a new pastorate. Supported by the new Ottawa Methodist Church Union, by 
        July of 1909 the Wesley Methodist Church building fronting on Hawthorne* 
        at Main was dedicated.</p>
      <p>As chronicled by Cy Chapman and others in the following <a href="Wesley%20Front%20Page.htm">&quot;History 
        of Wesley United Church&quot;</a>, the Methodists immediately assumed 
        a major role in the day-to-day life of Ottawa East. We are indeed fortunate 
        that, from the very beginning of the congregation, detailed records of 
        the activities and people who formed an integral part of the Christian 
        mosaic that made up the community.</p>
      <p>It is necessary at this point in the story of Ottawa East to remember 
        the important role the churches played in the life of almost every individual. 
        Think of the number of religious holidays and church social events that 
        took place each year and this represents only a portion of church connections 
        people experienced. Each institution took care of its own members by acting 
        as &quot;a social safety net&quot;, to use a modern term. And every church 
        supported the needy, no matter what their particular belief. Ottawa East 
        at this point was a community of Christians who adhered to the basic belief 
        of &quot;charity&quot;.</p>
      <p>Throughout this historical work, this writer has gone to great lengths 
        to include as many references as possible to the ordinary people of Ottawa 
        East. The vast majority of those cited were simply individuals that helped 
        create the fabric of the community. Ottawa East was (and still is) the 
        people. As an example of the Christian charity so evident in the Wesley 
        community, one need only <a href="Wesley%20Dorothy.htm">read about Dorothy</a>, 
        a lifelong member of the church. She, as well as countless others, were 
        part of what Cy Chapman describes as &quot;a simple, unassuming fellowship 
        of Christians paying homage to God in a family atmosphere&quot;.</p>
      <p>The link just below will take you to the astonishingly detailed story 
        of the Methodist heritage of Ottawa East. Originally written in 1982, 
        it was updated by Cyril Edward Chapman in 1996 and is reproduced here 
        with the kind permission of the author and the church. It is indeed fortunate 
        that the minutia of church life has been preserved, as this is the information 
        that keeps the history alive.<br>
