    <td>Fourteen years ago, a history of Wesley United Church, subtitled &quot;Ottawa 
      East's Methodist Heritage&quot; was compiled as a project of the official 
      board to mark the 1983 75th anniversary of the founding of the Wesley congregation. 
      In revising and updating that record, very little of the 1982 account has 
      been altered except for some minor editing, and those who may have copies 
      of that work will likely notice additions and some minor changes in phraseology, 
      but not in fact. 
      <p>Since the inception of Ottawa East's Methodist Church, its congregations 
        have, to a great extent, retained the characteristics of a small rural 
        house of worship. In contrast to the large congregation worshipping in 
        a huge stone edifice with soaring spire and liturgical pomp, Wesley has 
        remained the centre of a simple, unassuming fellowship of Christians paying 
        homage to God in a family atmosphere - a comfortable, yet seriously dignified 
        informality. Wesley is a relatively small church where a thankful congregation 
        has met each Sunday in form and manner little changed, until very recently, 
        from that of its forebears. Visitors have remarked on the attractive building, 
        and those who have remained long enough to know the Wesley 'family', have 
        found that the sanctity of the building in the hearts and minds of its 
        frequenters is surpassed at no shrine, abbey, cathedral nor any geographically 
        designated 'holy place'. Those who have been a part of Wesley through 
        the years, have felt the presence of the Holy Spirit within the confines 
        of the sanctuary as intensely as if they were entering any of the world's 
        great cathedrals.</p>
      <p>In compiling this account of the first eighty-eight years of Wesley's 
        history, care has been taken to include only those events that can be 
        verified by records existing when quoted or, in some cases, situations 
        known to be valid by virtue of the writer's participation or presence. 
        Many hours of research and delving into the minutes of congregational 
        and organizational meetings have resulted in what we hope will serve not 
        only as an authoritative historic reference, but an interesting and readable 
        narrative. We express our sincere thanks and appreciation to Andy Halvorson 
        for his time and effort in gathering re-cords and making initial notations 
        used in the early portion of this history. It was, in fact, he who suggested 
        the 1982 project. We also appreciate the work of others who have left 
        historical writings that have proved useful in research. And we thank 
        all who have helped in production, then and now.</p>
      <p>It has been difficult to decide how involved to become in recounting 
        the activities of the various church organizations, and the naming of 
        some members and not others might conceivably prompt. charges of favouritism. 
        This is not in the least intended, as we have striven to present the project 
        as an overall picture of the congregation's progress and accomplishments 
        over the years. In addition, some readers may recall personal or social 
        events which, while no doubt of interest to them, can not be counted as 
        vital in describing the Wesley fact and therefore do not appear on these 
        pages.</p>
      <p>To list organizational officers poses a particular challenge. Whereas 
        the names and tenures of clergy and laypersons serving Wesley were obtainable 
        with little difficulty, the names of Sunday schoolteachers, for example, 
        are not easily located and the list may well be incomplete. Some lists 
        include but a few dates and others show starting dates only. A date preceded 
        by a 'c' indicates that a person is known to have been active during that 
        year, but it can't be verified as the starting year. Unfortunately, gaps 
        appear in some chronological listings, as records in particular areas 
        are not available. An Elder remains ordained whether or not he or she 
        sits on the Session during a given period. Similarly, Trustees are replaced 
        only when one leaves or resigns; (i.e. they do not serve specific terms); 
        consequently, elders and trustees are listed in alphabetical format with 
        the year of original appointment. Any who have served in an official capacity 
        at Wesley will appreciate the monumental task and plethora of repetition 
        that would be involved in attempting to follow the several and continuing 
        retiring and reappointment of the same people to the Boards.</p>
      <p>With this document, we pray that those who occupy the pews of Wesley 
        United Church, and any who have an interest in its welfare, gain from 
        these pages some realization of the work and sacrifice of those who have 
        gone before in order that we might have our treasured place of worship-and 
        given that realization, continue in Christian concern and with God's help, 
        to maintain what they have loved so much and entrusted to us.</p>
