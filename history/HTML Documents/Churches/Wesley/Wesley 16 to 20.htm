      <p>Thanks were already being extended to Mr. Chapman in January of 1949 
        for his &quot;untiring efforts in the installation of the new organ&quot;. 
        A Wurlitzer electronic-reed organ had been purchased at a cost of $4,495 
        and installed in the church. The console was located at floor level beside 
        the west end of the stage, facing the congregation. The old organ pit 
        was built up flush with the platform floor. A remote amplifier and speaker 
        cabinet rested on a platform built above the inside vestibule door; and 
        its output directed into the sanctuary through an opening cut through 
        the rear wall. The newly installed instrument had a pleasing tone and 
        its registration combinations far exceeded those of its predecessor, which 
        was given an estimated value of ninety dollars and given to St. Marc's 
        United Church. Wesley's organist and choir director was Allan Hundevad, 
        a high school student and gifted musician who retained the post until 
        September, 1949 at which time the position was filled by Mr. Leslie G. 
        Smith. Allan Hundevad was partial to the music and service of the Anglican 
        Church and during his short term of about a year, organized a boys' choir 
        which with the permission of Session, applied for membership in the Royal 
        Boys' Choir Association. He left, however, before arrangements were completed 
        and his leaving saw the demise of the choir. Although short lived, the 
        choir performed several times at Wesley and its members were honoured 
        to sing at a military wedding at Ottawa's Christ Church Cathedral.</p>
      <p>The organ account was paid in full by 1950; this at a time when besides 
        contributing to the regu-lar expenses of the church, the congregation 
        was giving closer attention to the Building Trust Fund which at the close 
        of 1949 had accumulated $11,OOO. Commendable as these efforts by Wesley's 
        congregation were, they were paltry in comparison with what it would be 
        asked to accomplish just a few years later.</p>
      <p>Due to Philip McCready's studies in pursuit of the ministry, he found 
        it necessary to resign in November of 1949. His final sermon as Wesley's 
        pastor was delivered on the Sunday before Christmas. with no minister 
        chosen to succeed him and no prospect in sight, the Session was happy 
        indeed that, at the close of that service, a visitor, the Rev. Major M.J.D. 
        Carson introduced himself as a military chaplain and was successfully 
        prevailed upon to minister to Wesley until February of the following year. 
        He served again for a few months during 1952 following the departure of 
        Rev. JS, McKenzie; a minister to whom the congregation looked for stability, 
        but another pastor who stayed but a short time. Rev. McKenzie had been 
        inducted as Wesley's full time minister to take permanent charge of the 
        congregation on June 29, 1950 at a salary of $2,500. By December of the 
        following year, he was on his way to another charge in Weston, Ontario. 
        Ottawa Presbytery appointed the Rev. A. J. Love, assistant minister at 
        Chalmers United Church, as interim moderator while Major Carson filled 
        the pulpit and Wesley once again went shopping for a new minister. The 
        Pulpit Supply Committee was authorized to offer a salary of $2,600 plus 
        nine hundred dollars in lieu of a manse. Arthur J. Love was chairman of 
        the meeting at which the authorization was granted and he answered Wesley's 
        call himself at the above salary and free accommodation. 3</p>
      <p>The Rev. AJ. Love came to Wesley as its minister in June, 1952; a man 
        who was an energetic leader and a person used to being obeyed. Such a 
        minister is what the congregation needed at the time for the decision 
        was made - Wesley would build a new church on the adjacent property, and 
        it would face Main Street. A sign announcing that decision was accordingly 
        placed on the lawn.4 It read:</p>
      <p>&quot;THE NEW WESLEY UNITED CHURCH WILL BE ERECTED ON THIS SITE&quot;</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>The following two chapters are adapted from A. H. Halvorson's <i>Building 
        The New Wesley Church</i>, with his kind permission.</p>
      <p>The Building Trust Fund opened in 1944 with the initial donation of two 
        dollars by Mr. and Mrs. Clark McLeod, reached a total of $2,272.87 by 
        the end of that year and $19,111.20 by December 31, 1952. Input to the 
        fund came by way of personal contributions, banquets, special events, 
        bond and bank interest, stock dividends and. as might be expected, the 
        women's organizations. Although Robert Carson, Clark McLeod and Archie 
        McWade undertook to manage the fund at its inception, responsibility was 
        transferred to the church treasurer in 1947.</p>
      <p>It was at the Congregational meeting of May 1, 1951 that the church population 
        came face to face with the reality of the beginning of the new Wesley 
        Church project. The minister, Rev. J.S. McKenzie, explained that the meeting 
        had been called for the purpose of bringing all pertinent data regarding 
        the building of a new church to the congregation. Mr. Balharrie, a local 
        architect, was on hand to comment upon the options and possibilities of 
        a church building and presentations concerning potential growth., location 
        and raising of funds were given by members of the Building Committee. 
        As a means of intensi-fying interest and encouraging greater involvement 
        in the building project, the Building Committee was expanded to include 
        all members of Session, the Board of Trustees and the Committee of Stewards.</p>
      <p>The architectural firm of Abra, Balharrie and Shore was asked to prepare 
        preliminary sketches which were revealed at the annual congregational 
        meeting of January 10, 1952. On May 12th of that year, the congregation 
        was brought together to grant permission to build a church specifically 
        designed to accommodate at least four hundred persons. Its design would 
        be similar to the recently built Roseda1e Church in Montreal with the 
        addition of a basement, church parlour and a nursery. Not unexpectedly, 
        serious discussion took place with some doubt expressed as to the ability 
        of the congregation to finance the building of the proposed structure. 
        Helpful suggestions from the architect pointed out ways in which costs 
        might be cut and attention was given to such things as the maximum number 
        of Sunday School students and the largest number to whom Communion had 
        been served on a Sunday, compared to the proposed capacity. Eventually, 
        the Wallace-Thompson motion for construction of the new church as described 
        was carried by majority vote and the Rev. A. J. Love, chairman of the 
        meeting. expressed his feeling that Wesley must build. not for the glory 
        of the congregation, but for the glory of God and therefore, all pessimism 
        must be avoided.</p>
      <p>Slides of what was to be the new church were shown to the congregation 
        on September 8, 1952. They included views of the exterior, the grooud 
        floor plan, basement and balcony. The draft of an explanatory brochure 
        was also presented and ratification of the plans was duly moved. seconded 
        and carried.</p>
      <p>The decision to build was complete. The plans and specifications were 
        accepted and the one most important item now facing the Building Committee 
        was how and where to raise the necessary money. After considering several 
        options, it was agreed to hire a professional fund raising firm. On November 
        20, 1952, an agreement was reached with the Wells Organization of Canada, 
        Ltd. to engage in a</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 18</b></p>
      <p>fund raising canvass for an amount in excess of $60,000. between January 
        5, 1953 and February 14, 1953. The cost of the service was to be $3,000. 
        plus operating expenses, (clerical, postage, telephone, printing, etc.) 
        estimated at not more than $1,500. Wells representative, Richard Sears, 
        became supervisor of the canvass operation and an office was established 
        in the church basement with a telephone and a clerk - typist in the person 
        of Verna Strindlund.</p>
      <p>A structured canvass organization was formed of church members and officials 
        who were trained so that each person knew his or her specific responsibilities 
        and how to cany them out in order to ensure success. 1 The canvass as 
        a project in itself had an overall theme:</p>
      <p>Faith - in the need and in our ability to meet the need</p>
      <p>Prayer - the collective and individual prayers of all our members and 
        friends.</p>
      <p>Sacrifice - of our time, our funds, our talents and our ideas.</p>
      <p>This was the basis of the plan and it recognized the fact that to be 
        involved in the building of a church is a privilege extended to relatively 
        few in the total population of the Christian Church.</p>
      <p>Expectations and goals remained high throughout the canvass period which 
        involved many meet-ings, a Loyalty Dinner for all church members and an 
        intense visitation program carried out by the teams of canvassers having 
        first made their own sacrificial pledges. A standard of giving formula 
        of one dollar per week for each thousand dollars of annual income was 
        suggested, lasting for 150 weeks. Six weeks of concerted effort resulted 
        in unqualified success and at the conclusion of the canvass, announcement 
        of its success was made at the Sunday morning service where a pleased 
        congregation stood and heard a re-corded performance of the stirring Hallelujah 
        chorus from Handel's Messiah.</p>
      <p>Possession of the required signed pledges gave the Building Committee 
        the opportunity to seek funds from some willing financial institution. 
        However, it was only after several unsuccessful attempts that the Bank 
        of Nova Scotia was approached and persuaded that the Wesley congregation 
        was a dependable risk. The bank agreed to make available financing up 
        to $60,000, given the signatures of twelve members of the congregation. 
        The signatures were obtained and following a reduction in the size of 
        the Building Committee in February of 1953, it moved swiftly towards construction.2</p>
      <p>The architect was authorized to call for tenders which were opened March 
        30th and the lowest one accepted. The successful bid was submitted by 
        F .E. Cummings Construction Company, Ltd. in the amount of $89,272. The 
        contractor was notified of his success on April 12th and the committee 
        chairman purchased a spade which was plated and used by Mr. Clark McLeod 
        to turn the first sod at a ceremony on Sunday, May 3, 1953. In attendance 
        with the regular congregation and the choir, attired in their white collared 
        black gowns, were invited clergy: the Rev. John Macaskill, Chairman of 
        Presbytery and the Rev. Drs.Coburn, Norman Coll and Milliken. 3</p>
      <p>Next morning, a power shovel began digging and construction of the new 
        building was under way. At the same time, Rev. Love showed up to record 
        the first bite of the shovel on movie film and by the time the church 
        was completed, he had compiled a comprehensive filmed account of the highlights 
        of</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 19</b></p>
      <p>construction. As a personal physical contribution to the project, the 
        minister mounted a scaffold and laid the final brick atop the chimney.</p>
      <p>The corner stone was laid on Sunday, August 9. 1953. It was laid by Mrs. 
        Clark McLeod in place of Mr. McLeod who, because of illness, was unable 
        to accept the honour. Beneath the new corner stone was placed a stone 
        taken from the foundation of the old church. Chiselled into that stone 
        was the inscription &quot;1908&quot; in recollection of the founding of 
        the Wesley congregation. The older stone was prepared by George Chapman 
        and laid by Robert Carson. the church's longest serving member at the 
        time. The outdoor service, held at the southeast corner of the partially 
        completed building, was impressive and well attended. Many people not 
        connected with the church observed the proceedings from across Main Street 
        and the Lees Avenue intersection. They saw and heard the smartly uniformed 
        band of the Salva-tion Army Slater Street Citadel perform for the occasion 
        and the choir, standing where the steps approaching the front doors would 
        later be. Others taking active part in the ceremony besides the assembled 
        congregation. were the Rev. Robert MacLauchlin of the United Church Ministerial 
        Associ-ation, the Rev. Ralph D. Wright, Council of Churches; the Rev. 
        Charles Donald of Southminster United Church; Wesley's Rev. Love and Messrs. 
        Weldon Carson. Ted Clark. George Chapman and Fred Waterman. A 4&quot;x 
        4&quot; x 12&quot; copper box containing lists of the names of original 
        Trustees and current church officials, copies of Ottawa newspapers, a 
        copy of the United Church Observer, first insurance policy and sundry 
        other relevant papers pressed into a wax-sealed package by Mr. Chapman 
        was placed into a pre-pared recess within the new corner stone. </p>
      <p>The Ottawa Presbytery arranged a $10,000. loan on Wesley's behalf, and 
        the first installment of $5,000 was received in October as the Committee 
        considered the purchase of pews and a Communion table. Globe Furniture 
        Company of Waterloo was given the order for nave and chancel pews; cupholders 
        and bookracks at a cost of $5,835. A separate order was made for a Communion 
        table which was later received as a memorial gift from Miss Elaine Love 
        in honour of her parents, Rev. and Mrs. A. J. Love. Lighting fixtures 
        were chosen following visits to several churches. Enclosed, flat-lensed 
        square box units similar to those seen in the contemporary Canadian Martyrs 
        Church on Main Street at Evelyn Avenue. were installed. The balcony was 
        furnished with suitable pews taken from the old church, thus maintain-ing 
        a visible link with the first building.</p>
      <p>Grey vinyl roll flooring was chosen for the nave and the same in red 
        for the chancel. A gift from Harry Hayley &amp; Sons, Ltd., (a now defunct 
        manufacturer of concrete products) of cast stone steps re-placed the originally 
        specified brick steps rising to the chancel. Golden yellow tile was laid 
        in the vestry, parlour and basement hall. A used desk and tilting chair 
        were donated by H. H. Popham &amp; Co.. Ltd. and placed in the vestry, 
        while a 10 - burner propane range was installed in the kitchen.</p>
      <p>Unassembled pews which were cut, fitted and installed by the manufacturers 
        representatives, ar-rived on February 5, 1954. Two hundred nesting chairs 
        were received shortly thereafter, and with an ambitious collection of 
        volunteers scrubbing, dusting and polishing the new church building was 
        mad ready for the official opening services on February 28, 1854.</p>
      <p align="center"><br>
        <b>Page 20</b></p>
      <p align="center"><b>IX</b></p>
      <p>Forty-five years after its founding, the Wesley congregation dedicated 
        its second church building. The president of Conference, the Rev. C. Ferguson 
        conducted the service which as in 1909, was attended by a congregation 
        that filled the church and this time overflowed into the basement hall 
        where the proceedings were heard via a public address system provided 
        and temporarily set up by Mr. Fred Green. The processional hymn, &quot;The 
        Church's One Foundation&quot;, was preceded by the singing of &quot;All 
        People That on Earth Do Dwell&quot; to the familiar Doxology tune: &quot;Old 
        One Hundredth&quot;, to begin the service. With the choir members robed 
        in their new maroon gowns and those assisting Rev. Ferguson in their places, 
        the church keys were presented by the builder, Mr. F .E. Cummings, to 
        Mr. T.A Clark. Chairman of the Building Committee. Mr. Clark, in turn., 
        delivered them to the President of Conference with the request that the 
        church be dedicated:</p>
      <p>&quot;In token that this building has been erected for the United Church 
        of Canada, I deliver to you the keys thereof and pray you now to dedicate 
        it to the worship of Almighty God. &quot;</p>
      <p>Appropriate prayer, the reading of Scripture by the minister, the Act 
        of Dedication, presentation and dedication of offering plates, choir anthems 
        and a solo by Mr. T.I. Davies, the sermon delivered by Rev. Ferguson and 
        benediction by Rev. Love, comprised the first service of worship to be 
        held in the present church building. The same evening, another overflow 
        congregation heard Rev. Ferguson preach a sermon entitled &quot;The Power 
        of Growth&quot;.</p>
      <p>Gifts for use in the new church were received from several sources to 
        whom the Session returned letters of appreciation. The Women's Association 
        was given formal thanks for providing the opening dinner. Thanks were 
        also extended to Mr. Green for the P.A system, the choir director, Lt. 
        Col. C.A McRory and the organist, Mr. William Keizer, to Mr. and Mrs. 
        Robert Hill for entertaining the Rev. and Mrs. Ferguson and to Mr. Austin 
        Cross, well known local journalist and broadcaster, for his supportive 
        newspaper (Ottawa Citizen) and radio articles. .</p>
      <p>The Building Committee was dissolved in 1954. At that time, all bills 
        for the construction of the building had been paid. The total cost had 
        reached $103,252.55. To enable repayment of funds supplied by the Bank 
        of Nova 8Gotia; it was decided in late 1956 to arrange a $20;000. mortgage. 
        The mortgage was placed by the Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation effective 
        April 1, 1957, and final payment of $18,000. was given the bank on July 
        10th. A sub-committee of the Committee of Stewards (the Mort-gage Retirement 
        Committee) advised the Trustees on April 2, 1962 that sufficient funds 
        totalling $10,089.46 were available to discharge the mortgage. The sum 
        was promptly paid and the church freed from debt.</p>
      <p><br>
        Wesley's third mortgage burning service was held October 23, 1962. It 
        took the form of a congregational dinner with the minister, the Rev. Dr. 
        H.W. Pointen - presiding. The Rev. Arthur Waite, president of the Montreal 
        and Ottawa Conference; the Rev. R.L. Bacon, chairman of Ottawa Presbytery 
        and Lt. Col. the Rev. M.J. D. Carson, Assistant Chaplain General, participated 
        in the service and brought greetings to the Wesley congregation. The retired 
        Rev. A. J. Love recounted his personal recollections of the building of 
        the new church and screened his filmed record of construction. At its 
        conclusion, he<br>
