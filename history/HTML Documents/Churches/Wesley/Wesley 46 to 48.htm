      <p>with the advantage of their initial assessment surveys. The first date 
        of operation of the church's Women's Clothing Exchange was April 30, 1996.10 
        Later in the year, the Official Board allowed two outside organizations: 
        a prenatal class and a theatrical group, to use portions of the church 
        building, their having complied with the trustees' requirements.</p>
      <p>At the June, 1996 meeting of the Official Board, it was announced that 
        Ava Kelly, a trustee and current church caretaker, had asked the Session 
        to present her as a candidate to enter the United Church ministry. A Discernment 
        Committee was formed and was functioning as the year ended.11 Also during 
        June, the sloping portion of the lawn near the front entrance was replaced 
        by a &quot;Garden of Remembrance&quot;, a rock garden created by members 
        of the church to accept donated memorial plants and flowers. In 1996, 
        the church remained open for Sunday worship during July, after many years 
        of closing for the month. With the minister and organist taking their 
        traditional July vacations, and the senior choir absent for the summer, 
        local members conducted the services and provided music. 12 At its September 
        meeting, the minister informed the Board that the church's Worship Committee 
        had reviewed the new United Church hymn book: Voices United, and recommended 
        to an agreeable Session that it be adopted for use at Wesley. Sales promotion 
        followed with announcements from the pulpit and in weekly bulletins and 
        the church newsletter. The choirs were initially provided with the hymn 
        books using church funds, while a number of the books were purchased by 
        individuals as gifts or memorials. A fund was subsequently es-tablished 
        to receive donations to gradually obtain a sufficient quantity to supply 
        the congregation.</p>
      <p>Wesley's minister was an avid supporter of Ottawa Presbytery during 1996. 
        She was a member of the executive where she agreed to chair the Division 
        of Mission in Canada Committee. She was also a member of the Youth Ministries 
        Committee and became a part of the Conference implementation team for 
        the newly published &quot;Voices United&quot; worship and hymn book. In 
        addition., she retained the office of the Presbytery U. C. W. Chaplain 
        for a second year. A general meeting of the Ottawa Presbytery was held 
        at Wesley, November 12, 1996. On that occasion, a &quot;poverty meal&quot; 
        was provided by members of the Ottawa West End Community Chaplaincy. In 
        addition., a brunch furnished by Dave Smith, local humanitarian-restauranteur, 
        was held in the church hall following the morning service, November 24th. 
        The function was held to raise money for the W.H. Scrivens Memorial Fund, 
        a registered charitable trust fund established in 1993 to support the 
        Youth Ministry of the Ottawa Presbytery.</p>
      <p>For several years, the Sunday School has conducted a traditional Christmas 
        Eve service at Wesley. It has invariably been well attended and the informal 
        atmosphere and the participation of children has made it a popular event. 
        In closing the recorded history of the church up to the end of 1996, it 
        seems appropriate to mention some aspects of the latest Christmas Eve 
        at Wesley. Aside from late night Christmas Eve Communion services held 
        during the term of the Rev. Col. Ross, the Sunday School service remains 
        Wesley's observance of Christmas Eve. Local weather conditions through 
        the years have varied widely on that evening from unusually cold to unusually 
        mild; heavy snow to none. In 1996, the December 24th temperature during 
        the day remained above freezing. There was virtually no snow on the ground 
        and during the day, there had been brief periods of light rain. The temperature 
        began to drop during the seven o'clock service and later brought a few 
        snow flurries and high winds, demanding wary driving on pavement subjected 
        to a critical thaw-freeze temperature.<br>
        <br>
        The walkway leading to the church's front entrance was lined with candles 
        burning within open- topped paper bags as worshippers entered a waiting 
        sanctuary in anticipation of the annual event. Pastor Karen Niven-Wigston 
        delivered words of welcome. from the pulpit and, led by members of the 
        senior choir without their usual gowns, the Sunday School children proceeded 
        up the centre aisle holding </p>
      <p align="center"><br>
        <b>Page 47</b></p>
      <p>electric candles. All joined the congregation in singing &quot;O Come 
        All Ye Faithful&quot;. Sunday School students handled most of the ritual 
        portions of the service with Deirdre Sutton proclaiming the call to worship 
        and Erica Sutton leading in the prayer of approach. The youth choir sang 
        &quot;What Child is This?&quot; and Sunday School secretary-treasurer, 
        Anne Darwin, lit the final advent candle. The senior choir followed in 
        singing &quot;Calm Was The Night&quot;, a Christmas hymn written by the 
        late Hany Hill, one-time Ottawa musician and educator.</p>
      <p>The Christmas story was reviewed in readings and carols. Readings were 
        given by Melissa Carrigan, Karen Niven-Wigston, Abdul Ibrahim and Tim 
        Carrigan. The Sunday School sang &quot;Away In A Man-ger&quot;, &quot;Christmas 
        Is A Time...&quot; and &quot;O Christmas Star&quot; (tune: &quot;O Christmas 
        Tree&quot;). Frequent guest soloist, John Griffiths sang &quot;O Holy 
        Night&quot; and &quot;O Little Town of Bethlehem&quot; and the senior 
        choir sang again - the West Indian carol, &quot;The Virgin Mary Had A 
        Baby Boy&quot;. The message, traditionally delivered by the Sunday School 
        superintendent, was shared on this occasion with the minister, who read 
        a Christ-mas children's story.</p>
      <p>In addition to the processional hymn, the congregation sang &quot;Go 
        Tell It On The Mountain&quot; and &quot;Joy To The World&quot;. The service 
        closed with the senior, youth and Sunday school choirs joining togeth-er 
        to sing &quot;Silent Night&quot; and &quot;We Wish You A Merry Christmas&quot;.</p>
      <p>And so we come to the end of this portion of the story of Wesley United 
        Church.</p>
      <p><br>
        As 1996 is relegated to the pages of history, the United Church of Canada 
        continues in its en-deavour to capture the interest of young people and 
        attract those who have never been involved with the Christian Church. 
        There exists an intense desire to conform to what is described as a changing 
        environment, and Wesley is feeling that change. Organized youth groups 
        other than the Sunday school and a youth choir do not exist here. Our 
        young adults, however, are strong supporters of Ottawa Presbytery's Youth 
        Ministry programs. As has often been the case at Wesley throughout its 
        history, a men's group that had been flourishing as late as 1994, has 
        once again ebbed and awaits hopeful rejuvenation as the cycle revolves. 
        The men held four breakfast meetings in 1996 under the interim chairmanship 
        of Cyril Chapman, but interest was not sufficient to sustain the organization.</p>
      <p>Outreach remains a major consideration at Wesley, raising the profile 
        of the church locally and in Presbyterial circles. Weekly congregational 
        offerings, however, continue to trail the church's financial responsibilities 
        by some one thousand dollars per month, according to verbal treasurer's 
        reports. Income from organizational activities and outside donations remain 
        vital for the continuing existence of the church. The Committee of Stewards, 
        as well as the traditionally dependable and hard working U.C.W. continue 
        to struggle to help the church avoid debt. The Sunday School helps out 
        on occasion and the lately formed Women's Clothing Exchange, which is 
        not a fund raising organization, made a small dona-tion to the church 
        during 1996. Outside groups using church facilities also offer donations.</p>
      <p>With social issues kept before the congregation and liturgy reflecting 
        a departure from tradition, life at Wesley is undergoing a fundamental 
        change. Although the church's congregations have always</p>
      <p align="center"><br>
        <b>Page 48</b></p>
      <p>been somewhat informal in worship, while retaining an underlying sense 
        of fidelity and devotion, an even more participatory and dramatic style 
        of worship is evolving, as is the use of inclusive language and contemporary 
        terminology in liturgy and hymns. Also, a feminine influence within the 
        higher courts of the church, as well as at the local level, is clearly 
        evident. Whereas we have seen that in the early days of Wesley's existence, 
        decisions affecting church life were made almost exclusively by men, recent 
        years have shown a distinct increase in the election of women to boards, 
        committees and executive office. Of fifty-four such positions at Wesley 
        during the latter part of 1996 (excluding U.C.W. and Bamboo), thirty- 
        nine were filled by women. (figures based on Annual report, 1995. Annual 
        meeting, 1996 and actual count, 1996)</p>
      <p>-<br>
        This book is a history of our church; it is not a declaration of guidelines 
        for future policies. But one cannot help but wonder what may appear on 
        Wesley's horizon. Will there be an influx of wealthy members, or will 
        a committed and determined congregation continue to confront and overcome 
        situations as they arise? Will this church eventually amalgamate with 
        a like congregation? Surely, if the Wesley population is resolved to maintain 
        the dream of its pioneers, it must display a genuine bonding with its 
        church and what it represents, as well as a stewardship and conviction 
        equal to or greater than that of those who have gone before.</p>
      <p>The changes taking place throughout the Church will undoubtedly be acceptable 
        to some and not others. The hope is, however, that whatever the people 
        of Wesley United Church accept or reject, they will never forget nor supplant 
        the prayer of the founders of Ottawa East's original Wesley Methodist 
        Church:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>&quot;That the blessing of God may rest upon this church;<br>
          that the Gospel of our Lord, Jesus Christ may always be preached;<br>
          that countless numbers may find salvation within her walls&quot;<br>
          <br>
          Harold Kneen, 1909</b><br>
