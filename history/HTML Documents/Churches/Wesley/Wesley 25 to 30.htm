      <p>On February 15, 1958, the congregation's fiftieth anniversary was marked 
        by special morning and evening services with the Right Rev. Dr. James 
        S. Thompson, Moderator of the United Church, preaching at both. That anniversary 
        was also observed with the sale of souvenir plates and hasty-notes and 
        the anniversary dinner held in the hall the following evening.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the concerns and struggles at Wesley with respect to 
        midweek activities, church attendance and finances, there have been highlights 
        - some happy joyous occasions and some unsettling. Reference has been 
        made of the problem in choir seating resulting in its diminished size 
        almost immediately following the opening of the present church building. 
        On a more favourable note, however, it was during the new church's infancy 
        that Eva Miller, president of the Women's Association, led a group of 
        very hard-working members in a project that gave Wesley one of its most 
        laudable and visible assets at the time. They faithfully catered each 
        week to a professional men's luncheon at the Lansdowne Coliseum. After 
        the W.A commitment ended, Mrs. Miller and the ladies continued the program 
        for a time in an unofficial capacity. The ladies of the church, in sponsoring 
        projects within the building, included for several years, an annual anniversary 
        dinner. As the present building was first occupied in February, the anniversary 
        celebration for the fist few years of its use were held during that month, 
        but in December of 1959, the Session elected to observe church anniversaries 
        in October each year.</p>
      <p>&quot;By 1963, official views with regard to the election of women to 
        church office and the type of ac-tivities permitted within the church 
        building had changed. The first women elders to be elected to the Session 
        of Wesley were Mrs. J.B. (Eva) Miller and Isobel McWhinney on February 
        6th of that year. The use of the church hall was granted to the Young 
        People's Union for square dancing in 1960 and a few square dances were 
        subsequently held The playing of cards in the hall was sanctioned by the 
        Session when the U.C.W.'s Unit 1 requested that ladies of the Orange Lodge 
        for whom the unit was currently ca-tering dinners, be allowed to do so. 
        It was strictly understood that money would not be involved in any of 
        the games. That decision was reached at the April 4, 1964 meeting. Permission 
        had also been granted the boys' group to hold monthly Saturday evening 
        dances in the hall, but Sessional displeasure with the consequences was 
        voiced at its January, 1963 meeting, as this excerpt from the minutes 
        discloses:</p>
      <p>&quot;It was pointed out that contrary to the understanding on which 
        permission was originally granted for the holding of dances in the church 
        hall, advertising was being placed in nearby store windows. In addition, 
        the majority of people attending had no connection with the church and 
        con-sequently, the conduct of a number of the attendees left a lot to 
        be de-sired. This consisted of smoking in the Primary Room, on the stage 
        where a number of cigarettes were extinguished under the carpet, in the 
        furnace room and on the upper stairway. Dr. Pointen also reported that 
        the hall itself was not Sufficiently illuminated during the dance and 
        that he experienced decided lack of co-operation from some of the boys.&quot;.</p>
      <p>Approval for the use of the hall for dancing was withdrawn while the 
        Session sought clarification of the situation. After considering the proposals 
        of James MacFarlane for future boys' work programs, a committee comprising 
        Cyril Chapman, William Wilson and David Livie was appointed to draw up 
        guide--</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 27</b></p>
      <p>-lines to be observed in the use of the hall. The resulting proclamation 
        was submitted to the Christian Education Committee on February 11th and 
        received Session approval March 6, 1963.</p>
      <p>At the annual Congregational Meeting of the same year, George Chapman, 
        as a member of the Trustee Board, suggested a fund be started for a new 
        organ to eventually replace the existing instrument. He made a formal 
        motion to the effect at the congregation's 1964 annual meeting which was 
        seconded but defeated. Concern for the future of Wesley's organ was voiced 
        again in 1968 when a request was made by Edward Green, choir director, 
        that an attempt be made to raise funds for a new organ. A committee consisting 
        of Cedric Dale, Ivan Sparks, Thomas Davies, Wayne Pointen and Eva Miller 
        was appointed by the congregation and asked to determine the cost of a 
        suitable new organ or repair of the present one and re-port its findings 
        along with recommended action. The committee's report was presented on 
        February 25th, suggesting the repair of the existing organ at a cost not 
        to exceed $275 and a special fund be set up at the next meeting of the 
        Official Board for the purchase of a new organ. The organ was repaired 
        but no further action was taken. 1 The organ's condition was such that 
        it had undergone extensive repairs a year earlier when it was out of service 
        for a period of some ten weeks. During that time, the Bradley Piano &amp; 
        Organ Co. provided the church with a small electronic organ for which 
        the Committee of Stewards re-turned a gratuity of fifty dollars. 2</p>
      <p>An event occurred in 1966 that profoundly affected church board relationships. 
        Having com-pleted the building of the new church and paying all accounts, 
        there remained a residual sum in the Building Fund which had been administered 
        by the Trustees since being given the responsibility at the annual. Congregational 
        Meeting of 1958, at the dissolution of the Building Committee. The delicate 
        and sometimes evasive line separating the responsibilities of the Trustees 
        toward the building and property, and the purpose of the Committee of 
        Stewards in handling the church's finances, at times became almost invisible. 
        The fact that 8 new building had been erected naturally called upon vital 
        trustee participation and after completion, it had seemed logical to the 
        congregation to place everything with the designation &quot;building&quot; 
        into the hands of the trustees. Some saw the term &quot;Building Fund&quot; 
        as a misnomer since it no longer served to build the church. At the same 
        time, the Board of Trustees having been so intimately involved in the 
        construction of the building, saw the use of the fund in subsequent minor 
        renovations as within the realm of its jurisdiction and was carrying on 
        in what it believed to be the just fulfillment of its responsibilities. 
        The question of what board should deal with which items and with whose 
        money became a source of friction between Trustees and Stewards. In turning 
        to the newly adopted 1950 edition of the United Church Manual and supplementary 
        literature, it seemed that arguments on both sides were reinforced in 
        one paragraph and destroyed in another, subject to personal interpretation. 
        3 When in June of 1964, the Building and Renovation funds were transferred 
        from the Trustees to the congregation (read Committee of Stewards), relations 
        between the two groups dropped a few degrees and cooled even further as 
        isolationism set in, resulting in the inevitable charges of interference 
        and countercharges of noncommunication.</p>
      <p>By February of 1966, serving officials had tired of working under the 
        existing circumstances and watching dedicated members tender resignations. 
        An informal meeting was finally held on February 27th at the home of Mr. 
        and Mrs. Ivan Sparks when representatives of the Session, Trustee Board 
        and Com-mittee of Stewards joined in an attempt to once and for all define 
        areas of responsibility and remove the sources of irritation.&quot; The 
        meeting was a success and it produced for the boards, a six point Memorandum 
        to be used as a guide in relations between the Board of Trustees and the 
        Committee of Stewards. The fourth item listed in the Memorandum was seen 
        as fundamental to the smooth operation of the</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 28</b></p>
      <p>church, as it designated certain areas of responsibility which might 
        have been claimed by either group. i.e.:</p>
      <p>&quot;4. Following some discussion, it was generally agreed that the 
        following activities fall within the scope of the Trustees: buying, selling, 
        mort-gaging, constructing, renovating, remodelling, fencing, hedging insuring, 
        parking, landscaping, assessment for taxes and zoning.</p>
      <p>It was also agreed that the following activities fall within the scope 
        of the Stewards: heating, lighting, purchasing supplies, maintenance of 
        building, equipment and grounds (including painting or other decorating, 
        electrical, furnace or organ repairs), paying insurance premiums and paying 
        water, sewer and tax rates.&quot; .</p>
      <p>With peace and serenity restored between the two bodies, the Official 
        Board turned its thoughts to the upcoming celebrations of the Centennial 
        of Canadian Confederation.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>XIII</b></p>
      <p>The girls and ladies of the congregation wore period costumes at the 
        special services and church functions planned by the Christian Education 
        Committee during one of Wesley's most memorable years: 1967 Canadian Centennial 
        year. The Christian Education Committee was formed of representatives 
        from the Session, Stewards, Sunday School and other organizations and 
        interested church members. It was charged with the oversight and implementation 
        of the total educational program of the church. The secretary of the committee 
        in 1967 was James MacFarlane, an active worker at Wesley for a number 
        of years who became a lay preacher and who occupied Wesley's pulpit on 
        several occasions. Largely due to the organizational efforts of Mr. MacFarlane, 
        the C.E. Committee and Session devised a series of special Centennial 
        services that included the presence of various religious figures and internationally 
        known personages and parliamentarians, some of whom took part in the services.</p>
      <p>The pulpit on May 21st was occupied by the Right Honorable John G. Diefenbaker, 
        Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition in the House of Commons and former 
        Prime Minister of Canada. The congregation met Mr. and Mrs. Diefenbaker 
        informally in the church hall following the service and found them to 
        be a most gracious couple whose appeal to the children led to a surprise 
        visit to the Diefenbakers' home (Stornaway) on the occasion of Mr. Diefenbaker's 
        seventy-second birthday. His joy at receiving the children, most of whom 
        were dressed in Centennial costume, was evident in the photo appearing 
        in the Ottawa Citizen covering the event and in the personal letter received 
        by Mr. MacFarlane extending his &quot;warmest thanks&quot; to the class.	
      </p>
      <p>May 28th was designated &quot;International Sunday&quot;. The service 
        on that day saw the assembly of representatives from several countries, 
        drawn from local Embassies and Legations in Ottawa. Addressing the large 
        congregation that day was Dr. Grace Maynard, president of International 
        House. Numbered among the invited guests were Mr. J.A Stockwell, First 
        Secretary of the British High Commission and Mrs. Stockwell; Koichi Tsutsumi, 
        Second Secretary of the Embassy of Japan and his wife, and the High Commissioner 
        of Ghana, Mr. W. B. van Lare and Mrs. van Lare. The ambassadors of Korea 
        and Israel</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 29</b></p>
      <p>were also invited but sent their regrets. During the service, the flags 
        of a great many countries lined both sides of the sanctuary.</p>
      <p>On one particular Sunday, a plush red carpet stretched the length of 
        the centre aisle and the front of the sanctuary was adorned with the flags 
        of Canada's provinces and territories. The congregation stood. Outside, 
        a large black limousine glided to a stop at Wesley's front door at precisely 
        eleven o'clock in the morning of October 1, 1967. Their Excellencies, 
        Governor General Roland Michener and Mrs. Michener followed an aide-de-camp 
        and a lady-in-waiting along the carpeted aisle and took their reserved 
        places north of the centre aisle near the front of the church. It was 
        a very impressive special Centennial service with the Governor General 
        of Canada assuming the lectern and reading the morning Scripture.</p>
      <p>Annual Ladies' Sunday was observed September 24th. Occupying the pulpit 
        that day was Grace McInnis, Federal Member of Parliament for Vancouver-Kingsway 
        and on Men's Sunday, October 29th, the address was given by Robert Thompson, 
        M.P., leader of the national Social Credit Party. His talk was not a political 
        harangue, but an interesting and highly satisfying Christian sermon.</p>
      <p>Amid the planning of the numerous events marking Centennial year, Wesley's 
        own fifty-ninth anniversary was not overlooked.. On the Sunday set aside 
        for its observance, a former minister at Wesley, the Rev. Col. M.ID. Carson 
        returned to the pulpit. During the last quarter of the year, inter-denomina-tionalism 
        and the church's Christian mission were emphasized and at the October 
        16th anniversary dinner held in the church hall, the guest speaker was 
        the Anglican Bishop of Ottawa, the Right Rev. E.S. Reed. The Rev. Fr. 
        M. J. Brennan, Canadian Martyrs Church and Mrs. J. E. Alsopp of the Church 
        of the Ascen-sion were also in attendance.</p>
      <p>During the autumn of 1967 a Mission Festival took place with the church 
        hall transformed into a veritable &quot;United Nations&quot; display of 
        posters, banners and crafts of many countries, representatives of which 
        tended some of the displays. Even a few foods native to various areas 
        of the world were offered for sampling by the many church members, friends 
        and guests who attended the event. Still in keeping with the interdenominational 
        theme nearing the year's end, the Salvation Army's Brigadier John J.Smith 
        addressed the congregation at yet another special Sunday service. Because 
        of a schedule otherwise heavily committed, an invitation to Canada's Prime 
        Minister, the Rt. Hon. L. B. Pearson, whom it was hoped would bring the 
        year's celebrations to a close in December, was declined.</p>
      <p>Before concluding the account of Wesley's 1967 special events, it is 
        important that mention be made of a group within the church known as the 
        St. Andrew's Society. Within the structure of official church organizations, 
        it is not easy to decide under what classification this group might be 
        listed. Perhaps the closest to an accurate description of its place as 
        a church organization would simply be in the recognition of its activities 
        and accomplishments. It strove to serve the congregation in ways that 
        might easily be taken for granted by those who unknowingly benefited from 
        its existence. The St. Andrew's Society was responsible for the catering 
        of after-service social hours, not only during Centennial year, but on 
        many other occasions. Its members sought out church workers to receive 
        gifts and awards and provided plants and flowers for the church's elderly 
        and shut-ins,. The Society also produced a short-run series of newsletters. 
        Decoration of the sanctuary at special times of the year such as Thanksgiving 
        and Christmas was undertaken by the group for a time, following which 
        the duties were taken over by the Sunday School and later shared with 
        other groups.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 30</b></p>
      <p>The name of the group was undoubtedly the inspiration of James MacFarlane 
        who, being of proud Scottish descent, saw the use of the St. Andrew's 
        name as synonymous with the early follower of Christ. The concept of service 
        held by the group, and with the Union Jack, flag of the Commonwealth and 
        a banner easily recognized throughout the world (Canada's Maple Leaf flag 
        did not yet exist). That much of the society's work involved the preparation 
        and serving of food is not surprising, as its founding members were no 
        strangers to the commercial catering industry. Originators of the St. 
        Andrew's Society were James MacFarlane, Anne Carrigan (Darwin) and Beverley 
        Cleland. Joining later were Ruth Pointen (Foster) and Cedric Dale. Dr. 
        Harold Pointen was an honorary member.</p>
      <p>During 1970, the C.G. I. T. failed to attract sufficient numbers of suitably 
        aged girls to continue, so in June of that year it disbanded and a new 
        organization was formed of boys and girls between the ages of twelve and 
        fifteen. Earlier in the year, however, the dwindling C.G.I.T., along with 
        regular social acti-vities, conducted the Easter sunrise service and before 
        its demise, presented a floral arrangement for the church library founded 
        in honour of the late Dr. Pointen. The newly formed group was called TWYGS-The 
        Wesley Youth Group which with an initial membership of six, grew to fourteen 
        by the fol-lowing year. During its short tenure under the leadership of 
        Anne Carrigan. the TWYGS held monthly supper meetings at the homes of 
        parents and decorated the church at Thanksgiving. They went carolling 
        at Christmas time and with the help of Parker Smith and Tom Davies, set 
        up a floodlit creche above the church's front entrance. There is unfortunately 
        no record of this useful church group beyond 1971.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>XIV</b></p>
      <p>Although the Rev. Col. P. D. Ross occupied Wesley's pulpit in October 
        of 1969, he officially be-came the church's minister in September, 1970.1 
        Colonel (&quot;Padre&quot;) Ross was the first of two successive retiring 
        armed forces chaplains called to Wesley during the seventies and Mrs. 
        (Sybil) Ross proved to be a competent and pleasing soprano soloist and 
        a welcome asset to the choir which she directed following the resignation 
        Ivy Hewis in 1971. </p>
      <p>Early in the decade, Wesley once again became concerned with declining 
        membership and small Sunday congregations. To those who had not been paying 
        close attention to the situation, it must have come as somewhat of a shock 
        to hear the minister voice the opinion that the church's size did not 
        justify the services of its own full time minister.2 For many years, Wesley's 
        pulpit had been occupied by retired clergymen, appointees or students, 
        and while successive congregations were grateful and appreciated the work 
        of all of these people on behalf of Wesley, it was seen as a happy day 
        and a mile-stone in the church's history when it was first able to employ 
        a full time PSStor at the prescribed rate. It was a situa-tion that once 
        gained, would not easily be relinquished and the proposal that a minister 
        be shared with another congregation was discarded A serious attempt was 
        made, however, to implement the advice of Col. Ross; that Wesley take 
        a positive and optimistic view of the future and and its influence beyond 
        the walls its own building in cooperation with other groups and congregations.

      <p>The Session's Ivy Hewis, in her role of Missions Convenor, agreed to 
        serve as liaison between the Session and all other groups within the church 
        in formulating and carrying out mission projects. As an example, she reported 
        to the Official Board that the children of the Sunday School were corresponding 
        with girls in a west coast lighthouse and that the west coast's Dr. Kenleyside 
        had received packages from the Sunday School. At the same time, Mrs. Hewis
