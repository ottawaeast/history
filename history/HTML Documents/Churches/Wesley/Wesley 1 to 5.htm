        Page 1</b></p>
      <p>Canada, as a nation, was but forty-one years of age in 1908. Sir Wilfred 
        Laurier had just been re-elected Prime Minister and Lord Grey, donor of 
        Canadian professional football's top trophy, was Gover-nor General-vice 
        regent of Edward VII. Ottawa, the chosen capital of the Dominion, was 
        undergoing concentrated efforts by the Ottawa Improvement Commission to 
        beautify the city in response to wide-spread criticism that the former 
        Bytown presented an embarrassingly poor face, when compared to other world 
        capitals. The Commission was &quot;cleaning up&quot; the Rideau canal 
        by removing scores of sheds, facto-ries, warehouses and stacks of timber 
        from along its banks, and replacing them with parks and gardens, some 
        of them still in evidence. About the same time, a start was made on scenic 
        driveways with the controversial construction of Lady Grey Drive. I</p>
      <p>During the years following the turn of the century, Canada and Ottawa 
        applied their energies and skills to growing and building, both in terms 
        of physical development and progressive enhancement of commerce and industry. 
        While the Governor General travelled to Regina and Edmonton in 1909 to 
        lay the cornerstones for their respective parliament buildings, improvement 
        and renewal became the mind-set of Ottawa's residents and the city's motto 
        &quot;Advance&quot; was being taken seriously. The advance syndrome extended 
        into Ottawa East, a village which had lately become part of the city when 
        it was annexed by Ottawa in 1907.2 A number of Methodists spoke of a church 
        of their own in the community to which they might walk rather than travel 
        to McLeod Church on Bank Street, or uptown to the &quot;Mother Church&quot;, 
        Dominion. 3 Pretoria bridge did not exist and passage over the canal was 
        by a swing bridge linking Harvey Street with Argyle Avenue. This was not 
        handy to McLeod, the closest Methodist church--especially for children 
        who would otherwise have attended Sunday school. The Methodist churches 
        in Otta-wa, however, were recognizing the need for new congregations in 
        outlying areas of the city, and in order to assist in the establishment 
        of such new pastorates, formed the Ottawa Methodist Social Union. The 
        Union's first venture was the founding of a Methodist church in Ottawa 
        East.</p>
      <p>Early twentieth century photographs of such major Ottawa streets as Wellington, 
        Bank, Sparks or Queen seldom reveal more than a few carriages or wagons, 
        possibly an automobile or a tram and a hand-ful of pedestrians using the 
        cobbled or unpaved roads. This picture of unhurried serenity in midtown 
        Ottawa suggests an even more tranquil and quiet community in Ottawa East; 
        an area ideal for living and raising a family. But, Ottawa East residents 
        were neither slow-paced nor sleepy. They were, for the most part, working-class 
        citizens used to manual labour-railway employees, lumbermen, tradesmen, 
        mer-chants and government employees. Some with a strong rural background, 
        were but lightly urbanized and chickens and even a horse or two dwelt 
        in a few back yards for many years. The industry and tenacity of these 
        people were demonstrated in their establishing and maintaining Ottawa 
        East's Methodist church, and the legacy they left to following generations: 
        a devout determination.</p>
      <p>In the days before the parliamentary fire led to the erection of the 
        present Peace Tower and its carillon; when there was as yet no Chateau 
        Laurier Hotel nor a Union Station (present Conference Centre); when the 
        E.B. Eddy Company had a scant one year earlier introduced gasoline driven 
        trucks to the streets of Ottawa, Ottawa East was already providing a valuable 
        service to the area in the facilities it </p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 2</b></p>
      <p>offered the railroad. Upper Ottawa East was the site of rail yards, and 
        tugging and shunting steam yard engines puffed and panted day and night. 
        The Grand Trunk Railway cross town tracks bisected the northern portion 
        of Ottawa East as they paralleled Hawthorne Avenue, having passed coal 
        sheds, live-stock pens and machine shops west of the canal, continuing 
        through a switching area and roundhouse east of Main Street and south 
        of the present Greenfield-Nicholas connection. Beyond that, tracks passed 
        by more coal sheds lining Hurdman's Road, crossed the Rideau river, and 
        branched east and south.4 The initial services of the new Methodist congregation 
        were held virtually beside the tracks and the subse-quent church building 
        was no further away from the rail lines than the present building is from 
        the Queensway. </p>
      <p>The term &quot;Ottawa East&quot; in the early 1900's described a village 
        on the eastern outskirts of Ottawa. Its geographical location, in an unofficial 
        and non-arbitrary mode might roughly be represented as lying between the 
        Rideau canal and the Rideau river, bounded on the north by the curving 
        canal and extending to Nicholas Street and Hurdman's Road to the river, 
        and on the south, to the end of Main Street at Riverdale Avenue. Little 
        other than farm land was in evidence south of Clegg Street and east of 
        Main Street in the Brantwood area was low, swampy terrain considered unsuitable 
        for residential development. The area between Main Street's southern extremity 
        and the Rideau river was pasture land and the Smyth Road (George McIlraith) 
        bridge was still years away. The region was still without such local landmarks 
        as St. Patrick's College (1928) on Echo Drive ( present Immaculata High 
        School), Holy Canadian Martyrs (1930)on Main Street at Lees Avenue (present 
        Peace Latvian Lutheran Church). It did. however, boast Sainte Famille 
        church and school at Oblate and Main (1902), Ottawa East Public School 
        on Evelyn Avenue (Lady Evelyn, 1905) and the Village Hall (1895) on Main 
        Street at Hawthorne Avenue.</p>
      <p>&quot;This brief preamble about the social and physical makeup of Ottawa 
        East, circ. 1908, will provide a sketch of the community into which Wesley 
        was introduced. It may be easier to understand why a section of 1996 Ottawa, 
        appearing to be little more than a corridor for endless traffic to pass 
        through on its way to and from the city's core, presents so many facilities 
        ordinarily found in a small town or village: a Village (Town) Hall, English 
        and French language Roman Catholic churches, a Roman Catholic parish hall, 
        a Baptist church which boasted the only Sunday School in the area before 
        Wesley's, United. Luther-an and Anglican churches and a university, a 
        community college, a former convent and seminary as well as Separate schools 
        and a Public school. At one time there were three bakeries, a dairy and 
        brick and lumber yards. The city garbage dump was located at the end of 
        Lees Avenue opposite the Ottawa Gas plant for many years. All of these 
        bespeak the history of a closely knit , almost detached community bearing 
        a small town profile. With the passage of time, the city has expanded 
        eastward. but to those who grew up or lived for any length of time in 
        the area, Ottawa East will always be that special part of the city we 
        have described. Whenever &quot;Ottawa East&quot; is mentioned. they will 
        picture streets like Hawthorne Avenue, Main Street, Echo Drive and Lees 
        Avenue. They will recall names like Canadian Martyrs, Lady Evelyn, Walker's 
        Bread and Morrison-Lamothe. They will no doubt remember St Pat's, Mazenod, 
        As-cension Church and Wesley United</p>
      <p>This is the area and the people whom Wesley Methodist Church was established 
        to serve.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 3</b></p>
      <p align="center"><b>II</b></p>
      <p>On Sunday afternoon, December 27, 1908, forty Ottawa East Methodists 
        held their first church service in a rented hall, formerly a grocery store, 
        at number 30 Main Street. The service, which took the form of a prayer 
        meeting, was conducted jointly by Messrs. J. Y. Caldwell and Harold 1. 
        Armitage. The first session of the Sunday school was held January 10, 
        1909 with an attendance of twenty-four students and teachers.1 The first 
        evening church service was held on that date and once again, forty worshippers 
        attended and managed an offering of one dollar. 2 The introduction of 
        the envelope system of giving the next month increased offerings to five 
        dollars per week. From the beginning, the zeal of the congregation left 
        no doubt that, given its way, a true church building would be erected 
        before long. The members held a congregational meeting on May 15, 1909 
        at which they elected their first official slate of officers. Minutes 
        of that meeting reveal the following appointments:</p>
      <p>Stewards:<br>
        John Mehegan John Girard H.S. Kneen R Waterman<br>
        R Carson R. W. Riddell Albert Campsall R Anderson</p>
      <p>Recording Steward:<br>
        H.S. Kneen</p>
      <p>Representatives:<br>
        J. Mehegan R Waterman<br>
        J. Laishley A Hurst</p>
      <p>Trustees:<br>
        Mr. E. Seybold and other members of the Methodist Social Union were asked 
        to serve on this board for an unspecified period.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kneen, the recording secretary, was asked to write an account of 
        the work of Methodism in Ottawa East during the formative years before 
        the church was built.. This he did, and we are in his debt as he provided 
        a valuable source of material covering that early period in Wesley's history. 
        Mr. Armitage was selected to be the first pastor. He was to be shared 
        with Hawthorne Church, making Wesley part of a circuit. The minister was 
        to receive a salary of six hundred dollars with an additional allowance 
        of one hundred dollars for horse hire.</p>
      <p>The Ottawa Methodist Social Union was encouraged enough by the desire 
        and optimism of the fledgling Ottawa East congregation to form building 
        and fmance committees and purchase a 90' X 156' lot at the comer of Hawthorne 
        Avenue and Main Street from Mrs. John Graham at a cost of three thou-sand 
        dollars. 3 The Union met April 29 and selected Mr. E. Seybold to act as 
        treasurer of the building fund &quot;to carry on the erection of the church, 
        to receive all subscriptions and pay all accounts&quot;. Mr. Kneen writes: 
        &quot;This he did, in a very remarkable manner.&quot; Also, at that memorable 
        meeting, the new church was named Wesley. The building was erected partly 
        by tender and partly by volunteer labour of dedicated members.4 It was 
        a rectangular brownish-red brick structure on grey stone foundation walls 
        with a high-ridged wooden shingled roof whose gabled ends faced north 
        and south. The front of the church faced north with the main entrance 
        opening onto Hawthorne Avenue. At fIrst, the basement had a sand floor 
        and no partitions. There were no plumbing facilities and in the sanctuary, 
        wooden benches and chairs served as pews. A small raised platform was 
        located at the centre of the west wall and the choir area was</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 4</b></p>
      <p>set aside in the south-west comer, marked off by short curtains provided 
        by the church's already functioning Ladies Aid Society. It was a small 
        building on a large lot; but a lot that was put to good use on many occasions 
        as time passed, increasing the influence of the little church upon those 
        who loved it and worked so hard to keep it now that it had become a reality.</p>
      <p>Sunday, July 11, 1909 saw the formal dedication of the new Wesley Methodist 
        Church building. There were morning and evening services. Local press 
        coverage declared: &quot;For both (services) the church was crowded to 
        the doors, an indication partly, of the interest taken in the Ottawa East 
        Methodists by the older congregations in the city.&quot; The speaker at 
        the morning service was Rev. Dr. IE. Mavity, District Chairman and President 
        of the Methodist Social Union. His desire and enthusiasm can be said to 
        be the prime mover in bringing about Ottawa East's Methodist church. The 
        evening service was conducted by Rev. R.G. Peever, pastor of McLeod church. 
        There was undoubtedly a feeling of pride, joy and thanks-giving among 
        those who sat through the services; a feeling that only those who have 
        given so much of their time and resources toward the goal of opening a 
        brand new church can know. It was a situation that most had never known 
        before and would not likely experience again, Harold Kneen closed his 
        account of Methodism in Ottawa East from its beginning to the opening 
        of the first church building with the following paragraphs:</p>
      <p>&quot;A spirit of hopefulness prevails among the people, there being 
        every prospect of the speedy growth of Methodism in this district.</p>
      <p>&quot;That the blessing of God may rest upon this church; that the Gospel 
        of our Lord, Jesus Christ may always be preached; that countless numbers 
        may find salvation within her walls, is the prayer of the people and pastor 
        of Wesley Methodist Church. We thank God and take courage.&quot;</p>
      <p>So it was with such faith and dedication that the people of Wesley faced 
        the future. It was a full day. It was a momentous day and both the Ottawa 
        Citizen and the Ottawa Journal saw fit to mention that the days offerings 
        and donations provided the building fund with an additional $250.</p>
      <p>Sunday had been a day of impressive and solemn worship. The following 
        evening, however, was given to social festivity and celebration. One can. 
        picture a warm July evening and a small red brick church sitting as it 
        did, on a vast lot extending spaciously toward Main Street on one side, 
        and looking out across several vacant lots to the west. We can envision 
        the setting sun reflecting from the sparkling windows and glossy painted 
        trim; and glistening upon the roofs cascading cedar shingles, On the lawn; 
        daintily covered tables and the tinkle and clatter of cutlery and chinaware 
        proclaimed the opening tea, as an estimated seven hundred happy souls 
        enjoyed Wesley's first social function. 5 Only one day after the opening 
        of the church, the women of the congregation had embarked upon their career 
        of dedicated industry in planning and carrying out the church's social 
        programs. On this occasion, they were given help in serving tea by members 
        of the Ladies Aid Societies of the city's other Methodist churches. Following 
        the tea, a &quot;platform meeting&quot; was held inside the church. Once 
        again, the Journal reports that it was crowded to the doors. After four 
        speeches, the audience was favoured with entertainment. The speakers were: 
        His Worship, Mayor Hopewell, Rev. B. Thompson, Rev. F.G. Robinson and 
        Rev. Mavety. Mr. Seyboid occupied the chair and took the opportunity to 
        announce that the church was opened free from debt. A mortgage against 
        the lot had been arranged by the Social Union with the Graham estate for 
        $2,000. at 5% interest. In thanking those who had helped in the realization 
        of Wesley Church, Mr. Kneen made it a point to mention that the congregation 
        members themselves had contributed more than three hundred dollars.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 5</b></p>
      <p align="center"><b>III</b></p>
      <p><br>
        The first meeting of Wesley's Quarterly Official Board following the church 
        opening was held July 29, 1909. Officials from both Hawthorne and Wesley 
        were present and Mr. Armitage's salary was discussed. It was settled by 
        vote that he receive $600 for the year, with Hawthorne contributing $200. 
        It was suggested by the chairman, Rev. Mavety, that Wesley's finances 
        be conducted &quot;as they do in McLeod&quot; and that the newly elected 
        treasurer, Mr. Armitage, interview the treasurer of McLeod Church &quot;with 
        regard to same&quot; . We have no record as to whether or not such an 
        interview ever took place. It is re-corded, however, that the first leave 
        of absence ever given 8 pastor of Wesley was granted Mr. Armitage three 
        weeks after the church was opened. Certainly, it was earned. He had conducted 
        most of the services since the inception of the congregation and later 
        that year, was given besides preaching, chairing board meetings and serving 
        as treasurer, the additional responsibilities of appointing a caretaker 
        and re-solving the question of &quot;horse hire for the pastor or supply 
        to drive to Hawthorne&quot;. These additional duties were placed upon 
        the pastor at the board's second meeting, September 29, 1909. That meeting 
        also marked the initiation of the every member canvass as Messrs. Mehegan, 
        Kneen, Girard and Waterman were selected to visit the families of Ottawa 
        East to see how much each member was willing to commit to Wesley, using 
        the weekly envelope system. There were about forty families involved with 
        an average weekly offering of $7.75.</p>
      <p>Money, a seemingly repugnant subject to some when dealing with church 
        matters, has always been of vital importance to the Christian Church. 
        Wesley Methodist was no exception. In 1910, the ap-propriation for the 
        pastor's salary was raised to $750, with one hundred dollars for horse 
        keep and a bonus at the end of the year. With a membership now of sixty 
        at Wesley and thirty-eight at Hawthorne, Wesley's portion was to be $500. 
        These financial arrangements were made for a new pastor. Mr. Harold Armitage 
        vacated Wesley's pulpit in May of that year and Rev. W.A Wilson began 
        a two year ministry with the young church. This first change in ministry 
        was one of many to follow. With Wesley in its 88th year of existence, 
        no fewer than twenty-seven students, lay preachers and ordained ministers 
        have filled the Wesley pulpit, with four others acting as supervisors 
        during the terms of students and lay preachers.</p>
      <p>An organist, Mr. Stanley Doxstader, was engaged in 1910 at a salary of 
        two dollars per Sunday - playing the church's first organ, given as a 
        gift to the church by James and Elizabeth Laishley -and Mr. Waterman was 
        appointed caretaker with a weekly stipend of one dollar, although the 
        caretaker's salary was raised the following year to six dollars per month 
        during the winter with notice: &quot;...that the church be scrubbed once 
        per month, swept and dusted once per week and properly heated.&quot; And, 
        when speaking of money, the ladies' organizations must be recognized. 
        From the very outset, the Ladies' Aid worked at socials, teas and sales 
        and ran an organized &quot;Mite&quot; system in which certain committees 
        of the Society received small offerings (mites) from various members of 
        the congregation each month to be used in the operation of the Society 
        and, when possible, to make donations to the church treasury. Early donations 
        to the church were understandably modest. Ten dollars was a common figure. 
        But the church had as yet no inventory of articles and equipment necessary 
        to provide for social endeavours and the ladies had to turn at least some 
        of their efforts toward providing them. Although dishes were borrowed 
        from other churches for some time whenever Wesley held a church supper, 
        the ladies did provide a number of items themselves. Within the first 
        eighteen months of the life of the church, the ladies purchased among 
        other things: a Communion set, 200 teaspoons, a cupboard, 6 knives, 12 
        dozen plates, 4 jugs, one dipper, one boiler, a dishpan and four dozen 
        cups and saucers. Many things were presented to the church thereafter 
        among them a Communion cup filler and new hymn books. On one occasion, 
        ten dollars was given</p>
