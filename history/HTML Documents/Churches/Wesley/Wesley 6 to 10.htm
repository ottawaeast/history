      <p>&quot;to help pay the janitor&quot;, a noble gesture in view of the fact 
        that during the meeting at which the motion was passed, the treasurer 
        had just reported a bank balance of $18.05.<br>
        Other things were still required for the church; like a basement floor 
        and a proper kitchen and plumbing and washrooms. It was the 31st of July 
        in 1913 that the trustees accepted a tender of RM Saunders of fifty dollars 
        to install the sewer. They also sought prices for the installation of 
        lavatories and a sink in the basement. A committee was set up to call 
        for repairs to the furnace, pouring a concrete basement floor, installing 
        pews in the church and fixing the choir platform. The trustees evidently 
        had a crusading spirit that evening in their desire to accomplish all 
        of these things. They were ultimately done, however, and Mr. Robert Carson 
        in his early history of the church, reveals this interesting story of 
        how the money was provided to install the washrooms:</p>
      <p>&quot;The young men set themselves to build the Young Men's room in the 
        basement., which later became the kitchen and accommodated the infant 
        class...</p>
      <p>&quot;The Y.M.C. took over responsibility for picnics, Christmas entertain-ments, 
        etc. In the fall of 1913, a committee of Mr. Awrey, W.R. Water-man and 
        Robert Carson was appointed to interview Mr. J.R Booth, well known lumber 
        magnate, for the purpose of getting permission to use property at Argyle 
        Avenue and Elgin Street for a comer skating rink. This property was the 
        site of the old Canada Atlantic railway machine shop and still owned by 
        Mr. Booth.</p>
      <p>&quot;The committee called at Mr. Booth's residence on Metcalfe Street 
        and received quite a cordial reception. The old gentleman, lounging on 
        a couch, told the committee he had let that property to another club last 
        year and he was sorry, because they left it in bad shape. However, the 
        committee got into conversation with Mr. Booth, Mr. Awrey having some 
        skilled knowledge of farming - so had Mr. Booth, and other sub-jects were 
        discussed; blue clay, locomotives, etc. A very congenial eve-ning was 
        spent with light refreshments being served. One of the visitors said: 
        'Well, Mr. Booth, should you consider letting us have the use of the property, 
        we promise to leave it in good condition and will sign an agreement to 
        that effect..'</p>
      <p>&quot;Mr. Booth promptly replied, 'You men don't need any agreement. 
        To-morrow you will have a letter from my son giving you full privilege 
        to use the property.'</p>
      <p>&quot;So, in the winter of 1913 -14 the skating rink was in operation-quite 
        an undertaking but gallantly carried through. Huts for ladies and gents, 
        stoves, hose pipes. fending pay office - all necessary to a well estab-lished 
        rink. A very successful season was experienced. The enterprise finished 
        with a banquet to which J. R. Booth was invited (no rental was charged 
        for the property). A letter was received from Mr. Booth regret-ting his 
        forced absence and thanking the club for the condition the ground was 
        left in and a promise of again using it if so desired.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 7</b></p>
      <p>The receipts from that venture installed the toilets in the church basement 
        and the club hoped to repeat this venture.&quot;</p>
      <p>The Young Men's Club was actually the young men's class of the Sunday 
        School which had been given more or less independent status in 1910. It 
        was a very valuable organization of the church as shown in this and other 
        projects, including other skating rinks and tennis courts on the church 
        lawn - said to be among the fmest in the city. Unfortunately, the war 
        of 1914 -18 inteITupted the activities of the organization and it appears 
        to have continued for only a few years after regrouping at the wars end. 
        Notwith-standing, permission was granted the Young Men's Club in the spring 
        of 1922 to build the tennis courts. The interesting provisions accompanying 
        that permission are recorded in the minutes of a trustees meet-ing of 
        April 4, 1922...</p>
      <p>&quot;...that this board grant permission to the young men's class of 
        this church to use the church lawn for a tennis court for the summer season 
        of 1922; the tennis court to be constructed and maintained by the club. 
        Permission granted to use the tennis court six days a week, the games 
        on Wednesday evening between eight and nine p.m.. to be quiet. A reservation 
        of five feet from the east side of the church not to be used by the club; 
        damages to the property to be paid for by the club and windows of the 
        church to be protected by screens by the club. The net to be removed from 
        Saturday until Monday of each week, and that at all times there be no 
        objectionable language or conduct, such as dancing or gambling.&quot;</p>
      <p>That the Board's permission for the project was granted is not surprising 
        since the club, after re-organization in 1919, raised money for a piano 
        purchased in 1923 through the use of model piano banks (an idea used twenty-five 
        years later to purchase a Wurlitzer electronic-reed organ) which they 
        fashioned themselves, and the issuing of five and ten dollar bonds, repayable 
        without interest to those who would indeed accept repayment.</p>
      <p>With the gradual decline of the Young Men's Club, the first of a number 
        of attempts through the years to form a Men's Association was made. Its 
        tenure was not a long one, but Wesley's men, organized or not, provided 
        much aid in maintaining and upgrading the church. Even before they were 
        organized into an association, they worked diligently together in turning 
        the sand floor of the basement into one of concrete. Pencilled notes appearing 
        on the pages of Claire Mitchell's History of the Women's Association of 
        Wesley United Church describe the project in the following words:</p>
      <p>&quot;...members of the board voluntarily worked from 7 p.m. every night 
        until midnight digging and mixing cement. Wheelbarrows were certainly 
        kept busy, but in due course, a cement floor was laid.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Robert Carson singles out four particular names as well as others 
        in his mention of the project: George Gillespie, Bert Campsall, Adam Clark 
        and Mr. Saunders. All of these names appear with some regularity in the 
        early recorded thanks and appreciation for their church work. Janitorial 
        and caretaking services were performed in turn by several men and women 
        of the congregation during periods when it was not financially possible 
        to enjoy the services of a full time caretaker.</p>
      <p>In 1909, Rev. John Mavety and Edward Seybold, members of the Methodist 
        Social Union, had arranged a mortgage with property owner, Violetta Graham, 
        securing the property in their name. On May</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 8</b></p>
      <p>2O, 1912, the Wesley trustees accepted transfer of ownership from the 
        two gentlemen, having arranged a further mortgage of $2,000 @ 6% with 
        Ms. Graham. The deed. bearing a sale price of $2,825, was not registered. 
        however, until March 5, 1913. Discharge of both mortgages was registered 
        September 29 and 3O, respectively, 1930.</p>
      <p>In November of 1915, the decision was made by the Quarterly Official 
        Board to borrow $100 from the Bank of Ottawa by way of a two month note. 
        In May of the following year, the extended note became due and was renewed 
        with an additional fifty dollars for Sixty days. The concern of the Board 
        for the financial picture was made manifest a year later (1917) when the 
        following resolution was voiced:</p>
      <p>&quot;Resolved that the Quarterly Official Board of Wesley Methodist 
        Church is of the opinion that in order to have this carried on efficiently 
        during the next few years, it be affiliated with Dominion Church. &quot;</p>
      <p>There is no record of this ever happening.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>IV</b></p>
      <p>When Wesley Church was built, it faced Hawthorne Avenue. At that time, 
        Hawthorne swept broadly from Echo Drive to Main Street and passed close 
        to the church's front entrance. As early as 1912, word was out that changes 
        were contemplated in the routing of Hawthorne Avenue. Mr. Saunders was 
        appointed by the Official Board in February to approach the City Engineer 
        to learn what effect the straightening of the street would have on Wesley 
        church property. The wheels at City Hall ground slow-ly. It was May 11, 
        1914 before the trustees were able to register agreement with the City 
        Engineers proposal to open Graham Avenue from Echo Drive to Main Street 
        with the understanding that Graham Avenue would become the main thoroughfare 
        leading from the proposed new bridge (Pretoria) to span the canal. Meanwhile, 
        lawyers acting on behalf of the owners of the land lying north of Hawthorne 
        Avenue (where Hawthorne Avenue is now); people named O'Gara, asked whether 
        the Board would agree to the closing of (the then existing) Hawthorne, 
        providing the cost of altering the church entrance be borne by the O'Gara 
        estate. This altering of the church entrance meant the abandonment of 
        the main door on the north end of the building, and cutting a new entrance 
        into the church's south end. facing the new Graham Avenue. The changes 
        to Hawthorne Avenue would move it northward away from the church and leave 
        a space between the church and the street of about the depth of a residential 
        building lot. The front door of the church would then have opened into 
        the back yard of any houses built on the south side of the relo-cated 
        Hawthorne Avenue. The Board replied to the O'Gara query stating that it 
        would expect compensa-tion of three thousand dollars and replacement of 
        the sidewalk with one equal to the walkway in use that extended from the 
        front door of the church to main Street, at no additional expense to the 
        Board.</p>
      <p>Six years after the first recorded interest of the church in the proposed 
        changes, the trustees and representatives from the Quarterly Official 
        Board met to consider a letter received from Mayor Harold Fisher. The 
        letter detailed the planned changes and included figures for the cost 
        of damage to church property that the city was willing to pay. It makes 
        interesting speculation to wonder what the outcome of the whole exercise 
        would have been had the church refused to finally concur. Wesley countered 
        with a request for the city to undertake the following:</p>
      <p>The document originally transfering ownership the Main Street-Graham 
        Avenue lot to the Wesley trustee board still exists. It is mainly hand-written 
        and not of clear enough quality to directly reproduce here; so a portion 
        of the deed is transcribed below.</p>
      <p align="center">(Editor's Note: This document has been omitted)</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 9</b></p>
      <p>&quot; 1. The street to the north of the church property would be closed 
        and church relieved from further payment on account of pavement or other 
        local improvements.</p>
      <p>2. Graham Avenue will be opened nom Main Street to Echo Drive<br>
        prior to the closing of Hawthorne Avenue to traffic.</p>
      <p>3. The city will put in any local improvements such as sidewalks, sewers, 
        etc. upon request. These improvements will be paid for in the usual way 
        on condition that what has already been paid on sidewalk to the north 
        of the church be applied on new sidewalk on the north of Graham Avenue 
        and that this sidewalk will be built nom Main Street to Echo Drive prior 
        to the closing of sidewalk north of Hawthorne Avenue.</p>
      <p>4. The city will pay to the church, $1,800. The church will move the 
        entrance or do anything they deem with the money and that this money be 
        paid to our Secretary within ninety days nom the signing of the agreement 
        between the Church and the City.&quot;1</p>
      <p>The above resolution was sent to the mayor following approval of lawyer, 
        Mr. AE. Honeywell. By the end of October, 1917, an agreement was finally 
        drawn up, and with the addition of a fifth clause, accepted. The additional 
        clause read:</p>
      <p>&quot;5. The Corporation undertakes that prior to the closing of access 
        to church by way of the present Hawthorne Avenue, the Corporation will 
        construct a sidewalk on the north side of Graham Avenue nom Main Street 
        to Echo Drive; the cost of same to be borne as provided by the Lo-cal 
        Improvement Act and by the By-laws of the Corporation.&quot;2</p>
      <p>No further correspondence is noted regarding the O'Gara matter and nowhere 
        does it appear that the church ever received $3,000 nom that source. A 
        cheque for $1,800 was received nom the City early in 1918, however, and 
        the Board turned its attention to the alterations and renovations made 
        necessary. In due course, several changes were made to the church building. 
        The existing porch was removed and the entrance bricked up. A new brick 
        porch (vestibule) was built on the southeast comer with the en-trance 
        landing providing steps up to the main floor and a stairway to the basement. 
        A Mr. Nelson was employed to supervise and assist in the carrying out 
        of the renovations.</p>
      <p>Although some bother and expense must be expected in virtually turning 
        a building around, in Wesley's case, it was not all bad. The same year, 
        the mortgage was reduced by half when $1,000 was re-paid to Mrs. Emma 
        Grist on May 20th, leaving a thousand dollar balance. 3 And, for the time 
        being, at least, building construction, improvements and renovations held 
        a less prominent position in the consid-erations of the congregation.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>V</b></p>
      <p>Already in the life of Wesley Methodist Church, the congregation had 
        greeted and bade farewell to five pastors. With frequent changes in pastoral 
        care, one might hope that the church's members, </p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 10</b></p>
      <p>its departments and organizations would maintain a cohesiveness and interest 
        in continuing responsibilities that would minimize disruption of their 
        programs through changing pulpit supply. Such hope has been justified 
        throughout the history of Wesley. Leaders and workers were prolific during 
        the church's forma-tive years. It could be open to some debate as to whether 
        it was because the church was new and the novelty attracted attention. 
        or whether it was due to a more devout attitude toward church work in 
        days past, that so much was done by such dedicated pioneers. Either way, 
        in poring over long forgotten hand written accounts of early events and 
        minutes of various organizational meetings, we cannot help but dis-cern 
        a deep moral conviction of the writers in the very terminology and detail 
        they included in whatever they wrote about their church.</p>
      <p>By the time the church opened on Hawthorne Avenue - little more than 
        six months - the Sunday School had grown from eighteen scholars, six teachers 
        and a secretary, to a roll of 76 pupils and ten teachers and officers. 
        There were eight classes, including the young men's class.I And the ranks 
        of students and teachers continued to grow. During its formative years., 
        the Ladies 'Aid Society with a member-ship hovering around twenty - not 
        counting a number of honorary gentlemen members-maintained an unbroken 
        series of sales, teas, suppers and lawn socials held beneath a tent pitched 
        on the church lawn. The women at Wesley established at a very early stage, 
        a name for themselves far and wide for the excellence of their church 
        dinners. The affairs were held under very trying conditions for many years. 
        At first, the church lacked proper kitchen facilities. Later, the basement 
        area became too cramped to efficiently serve the many people who showed 
        up at the popular dinners. The usual practice was for the ladies to cook 
        various components of a banquet in their homes and heat those dishes on 
        (or in) the church stove while preparing the rest of the meal as facilities 
        permitted.</p>
      <p>The Ladies' Aid Society didn't stop at meals and teas. They accepted 
        responsibility for furnishing the parsonage on Hazel Street, rented for 
        the Rev. J.T.E. Blanchard in 1912. In this, the ladies received much appreciated 
        help from their counterparts at Dominion, McLeod and Ottawa South Churches. 
        The furniture was removed in July of the following year and sold, the 
        $133.65 realized from the sale being deposited in Bank of Nova Scotia 
        account opened for the purpose. 2 Rev. Blanchard was off to another charge 
        and Wesley welcomed Mr. Arthur Willans who occupied the pulpit for a year.</p>
      <p>The congregation worshipped and worked together through progressing years 
        and the Sunday School grew to the point where at the Annual Sunday School 
        Rally at Dominion Church on New Years Day, 1917 (incorrectly recorded 
        1916?), 114 Wesley Sunday School scholars were present to see their superintendent, 
        John Baron. receive from the president of the Methodist Sunday School 
        Association. the banner awarded for the highest weekly average attendance 
        of all city Methodist Sunday Schools. The average 1916 weekly attendance 
        was 107.5. Further work was done on the church basement by the Men's Association 
        and in November of 1921, the Official Board considered a letter from the 
        Secretary of the Methodist Conference. The letter asked that the Board 
        vote on the question of extending to women, equal rights and privileges 
        with men to become probationers and ministers of the church. A ballot 
        vote was taken and the result was three in favour; eleven opposed.</p>
      <p>A very important event in the life of the Methodist Church was approaching 
        and surprisingly little reference is made to it in the official writings 
        of Wesley. Church Union. Perhaps the people at Wesley were not particularly 
        excited at the prospect; we simply don't know. Picturing Wesley Methodist 
        Church during the years approaching union: the Sunday School enjoyed 8 
        membership of 125 in 1923 with an average weekly attendance of 58 - down 
        considerably from a few years earlier but still ten more than average 
        church attendance. The minister's salary had dropped to $700 and the year 
        ended with a fi-nancial deficit.<br>
