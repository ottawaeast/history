    <td>Dorothy Alice Wallace (nee Caldwell) was born on November 28, 1914 in 
      Ottawa. Affectionately known as &quot;Dot&quot;, she passed away on November 
      4, 2002 at the age of 87 years, 11 months and 7 days. In all that time she 
      remained committed to her church as a necessary part of her life. 
      <p>The earliest reference to Dorothy in the church records is her&quot;coming 
        to Christ&quot; in 1926 <a href="../../Image%20Library/People/X_Ethel%20and%20Dot%201920s.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/People/sm/X_Ethel%20and%20Dot%201920s%20sm.jpg" width="111" height="164" align="left" alt="Ethel and Dorothy Caldwell c1930" border="0"></a>when 
        she joined the church as a member along with her sister Ethel. Ottawa 
        East in the 1920's was a patchwork of<a href="../../Image%20Library/People/X_Dorothy%20Caldwell%20c1930.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/People/sm/X_Dorothy%20Caldwell%20c1930%20sm.jpg" width="98" height="141" align="right" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="Dorothy Wallace (nee Caldwell)" border="0"></a> 
        devout &quot;church-goers&quot; that staunchly defended their particular 
        view of Christ and the Crown. Dorothy was no different. A person's social 
        life revolved around their church. From dances to picnics, from weddings 
        to teas, it was Wesley's social milieu that welcomed a young Dorothy to 
        Ottawa East.</p>

        met and married Newell Albert Donald Wallace (born January 1, 1915, died 
        August 21, 1981) in Ottawa East. &quot;Knute&quot; worked for the City 
        of Ottawa Water Department and was also known as &quot;The Christmas Tree 
        King of Ottawa East&quot; in that he annually sold trees from the family 
        home on Concord Street. They moved to 117 Concord St., located between 
        Hawthorne Avenue and the &quot;tracks&quot; (Queensway) in 1951, raised 
        a family and remained there until their passing.</p>
      <p><br>
        <br>
        Throughout her life in the community, 'Dot' exhibited the Christian charity 
        taught by her church. At the risk of being too indulgent, let me tell 
        you just one story that exemplifies the kind heart and decency of this 
        special woman - <u>my mother</u>.</p>
      <p>I grew up on Concord Street, near the railway tracks that brought the 
        coal to fill the sheds that bordered our backyard. Daily rumblings of 
        freight and passenger trains went unnoticed - it was a part of life. The 
        rails also brought some interesting people.</p>
      <p>One of my earliest memories was that of sitting at the kitchen table 
        and hearing a knock at the back door. I remember my mother regularly opening 
        the back door to &quot;another bum&quot; (also known as &quot;rubby-dubs&quot; 
        or tramps). These were the men who rode the rails living off what ever 
        they could beg or borrow. Always dressed in worn clothes, with a ruddy 
        complexion, rarely shaved, young and old, they were always very polite 
        (it was &quot;Yes Missus&quot;) when asking for a handout. Not one ever 
        asked for money and many offered to do work in return for food. My mother 
        always found something to give, even when it was close to pay-day. Some 
        crackers and cheese, sandwiches if she was making them, maybe 4 or five 
        potatoes - enough for a meal. It was the Christian way according to my 
        mother.</p>
      <p>The question I asked myself when young was &quot;Why do they always come 
        to our door?&quot; My buddies never reported such occurrences - why us? 
        It wasn't until years later, while watching a documentary on railway tramps 
        that I learned the answer. Our house, so close to the tracks, had been 
        marked. These men had a universal system of identifying houses that were 
        friendly and willing to help out a respectful traveler. </p>
      <p>You couldn't ask for a clearer, more honest endorsement of this woman. 
        No, 'Dot' was never elected to office; she didn't operate a business and 
        never wrote a book. She simply led a decent hardworking life and shared 
        what she had in a Christian way. It was the teaching of her Saviour and 
        church that guided her - &quot;Suffer the poor&quot; - including the bums.</p>
      <p>Dorothy is but one example of the many good people who have lived in 
        Ottawa East. She did her part and left a legacy. And part of her legacy 
        is this &quot;History of Ottawa East&quot;, a story that she always wanted 
        written. I promised her!<br>
