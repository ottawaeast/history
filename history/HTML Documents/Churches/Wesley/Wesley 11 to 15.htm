      <p>financial deficit. Church Union meant the amalgamation of most of Canada's 
        Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational churches. The Plymouth Brethren 
        joined later. Up to this point, no dissatisfaction is noted in Wesley's 
        dealings with the Methodist Conference, but the minutes of the Quarterly 
        Official Board meeting of March 10. 1925, suggest that there may have 
        been some lack of enthusiasm for the Conference's relationship with Wesley. 
        Whether or not such an attitude was justified - or even existed - is of 
        little consequence today, but it seems reasonable to suppose that during 
        the transition from Methodist to United Church, some would question whether 
        the new format would be any better than the former.</p>
      <p>The discussion at the Official Board meeting concerned pulpit supply. 
        The Rev. W.J.G. Brown had just informed the Board that Mr. Learoyd, the 
        current pastor, was forced because of ill health to give up the pulpit. 
        The following excerpt suggests that many in attendance - at least at that 
        time - saw the Conference as somewhat suspect in any concern for the welfare 
        of Wesley; a considerable departure from the interest shown by the local 
        Ottawa Methodist Social Union at the congregation's inception...</p>
      <p>&quot;...the possibility of having someone appointed in charge of this 
        church came in for considerable discussion. Rev. Dr. Brown explaimd to 
        the Board the position of the Conference in relation to Wesley Church 
        and the difficulties involved in getting suitable ministers. The condition 
        of the church and its relation to the Conference involved a discussion 
        in which nearly all present expressed themselves.&quot;</p>
      <p>They did manage to find a minister willing to take charge until June: 
        the Rev. E.L. Flagg. He introduced Rev. J. F. MacFarland to the congregation 
        which accepted him as its first United Church pastor. He remained for 
        the next six years; the longest term of a minister since Wesley's beginning. 
        It was June. 1925. and although the existing organizational structure 
        within the congregation was retained until 1927. Ottawa East's Methodist 
        congregation became a part of Canada's largest Protestant denomination. 
        Thereafter it would be known as Wesley United Church.</p>
      <p>That momentous year marked the sixteenth anniversary of the church. There 
        were special Sunday services and a social gathering in the church the 
        following Tuesday. the ladies naturally providing the supper. Preaching 
        at the anniversary services were the Rev. AF. Pollock, First United Church, 
        and Rev. J. W. Woodside of Chalmers United Church. Speakers at the social 
        evening were the Rev. J. R. Watt and Rev. Dr. Robert Milliken</p>
      <p>A year earlier-in March of 1924--the Woman's Missionary Society was formed. 
        Its first president was the minister's wife, Mrs. George C. Wood, and 
        it boasted an initial membership of fifteen. The final meeting of the 
        Ladies' Aid Society was held September 6. 1928. and the first meeting 
        of its descendant, the Women's Association of Wesley took place on October 
        4. 1928.</p>
      <p>The W.M.S.. whose purpose it was to promote the cause of Missions and 
        raise funds for that pur-pose. organized the &quot;Onward&quot; Mission 
        Band. This consisted of a group of young children who were taught about 
        foreign lands and mission work throughout the world They raised money 
        through various projects. including &quot;mite&quot; boxes. as used by 
        the former Ladies' Aid Society. and at the same time, gained at an early 
        age. a knowledge of how to properly conduct an organized meeting and handle 
        its business.</p>
      <p>In April of 1927. a seven man. Committee of Stewards, a secretary and 
        a treasurer were chosen at the annual Congregational Meeting. At B further 
        special meeting on May 11th, Trustees were appointed</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 12</b></p>
      <p>with respect to the terms of the (United Church) &quot;Model Trust Deed&quot;, 
        and Elders elected to form the Ses-sion of Wesley under the United Church 
        of Canada's &quot;Basis of Union&quot;. Both of these documents were explained 
        in the United Church Manual. A total of four Elders were elected and as 
        they were Wesley's first. it is worthwhile noting their names here:</p>
      <p>Fred Bateman. Sr. for 4 years <br>
        Lincoln E. Wereley for 3 years<br>
        Clark McLeod for 2 years <br>
        Robert Waterman for 1 year</p>
      <p>The new members of Session were ordained as Elders at a solemn service 
        performed by the Rev. IW. Woodside, Chairman of Ottawa Presbytery, at 
        Wesley United Church's ftrst Session meeting on the evening of May 29, 
        1927. .</p>
      <p align="center"><b>VI</b></p>
      <p>Church anniversaries are always cause for thanksgiving and celebration. 
        The thanksgiving becomes more sincere and the celebrating a little more 
        joyful when a twenty-one year old mortgage is burned as a part of the 
        festivities. So it was at Wesley on the evening of Tuesday, October 7, 
        1930. Three hundred people were on hand at the twenty-first anniversary 
        supper, served by the ladies of the Women's Association. Robert Carson, 
        in his historical account, describes the mortgage burning:</p>
      <p>&quot;Felicitations were extended to the congregation by Rev. G. B. McLen-nan 
        of First United Church. Rev. W.R AIf of Chalmers Church and Rev. F.S. 
        Milliken of Stewarton Church. A feature of the evening was the burning 
        of the mortgage. In a well defined and very appropriate address by Mrs. 
        B.W. Campsall, president of the Women's Association, through whose effort 
        this feature of the program was made possible, and in the presence of 
        Trustees who were called to the platform-Messrs. RM. Saunders, B.W. Campsall, 
        R Waterman. W.F. Jackson, W. Hall, H.S. Kneen and George Gillespie. Mr. 
        IY. Caldwell, one of the original Trustees and Mr. B.W. Campsall each 
        lit a comer of the mortgage. After it burned out, the audience rose and 
        sang the Doxology. ('Praise God from whom all blessings flow...')</p>
      <p>The progressive renovations and improvements to the church building which 
        had slowed a little following the conversion from Hawthorne to Graham 
        Avenue frontage moved ahead again in 1932 with Archie McWade and members 
        of the Men's Association moving the furnace and covering the basement 
        walls (vertical vee-joint boarding) while, during 1933, members of the 
        Young People's Association., Cedric Dale presiding, completed the task 
        of reshingling the roof. In the sanctuary, George Chapman agreed to build 
        a larger platform at the north end to replace the existing one against 
        the west wall. A number of pews, a pulpit and high-back cl1air were purchased 
        from Southminster United Church for the sum of one hundred dollars, and 
        25 of Wesley's old chairs were sold to West Ottawa United Church for a 
        dollar each.</p>
      <p>Mr. Chapman cut and fitted the pews and when the pulpit was set on the 
        forward centre of the new platform and the solid oak waist-high choir 
        fences that extended from either side of the pulpit to the</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 13</b></p>
      <p>platform edges were in place; when the electrified Dominion reed organ, 
        purchased in March of 1936, was tucked comfortably into its pit behind 
        the pulpit (with the organist facing away from the congrega-tion), and 
        the hymn board placed on the front wall beside where the entrance used 
        to be. the church took on the form it would have until it was eventually 
        deserted for a new building. At the same time, Mr. Alwyn Peters did a 
        splendid job of redecorating the church interior. About the only other 
        major undertaking in the little red brick church was the installation 
        of a new Wurlitzer electronic-reed organ in 1948 and much needed kitchen 
        cupboards built mainly by Andy Halvorson and S.A (Bernie) Richards in 
        1949.</p>
      <p>The new arrangement of the sanctuary made a pleasing difference in the 
        sacred ambience of the room. The pews transformed the area from a hall-like 
        atmosphere to one of a genuine church sanctuary. The pulpit was removable, 
        as were the two choir fences. Choir members sat upon ordinary brown painted 
        wooden chairs placed on the platform on either side of the organ, so when 
        it was desired to use the platform as a stage for entertainment, it was 
        easily converted to such use. A large grey blanket thrown over the organ, 
        a few Sunday School children dressed in kimonos and terry-towel head dress, 
        a &quot;lamb&quot; or two and dimmed lights created a suitable Galilean 
        hillside for a Christmas pageant. And during the thirties and forties, 
        there were many. Not a year went by that there wasn't a Christmas concert 
        with a large decorated Christmas tree beside the stage, (the platform 
        did not extend the full width of the church), and beneath it, gifts from 
        teachers to pupils, bags of candy and always a large orange for every 
        child. Santa Claus gave out the packages, candy and oranges when he finally 
        arrived after many &quot;progress reports&quot; of his journey during 
        the evening. Entertainment consisted mainly of talent within the church 
        and Sunday School. The young men's class and Weldon Carson's Dramatic 
        Club came in for many accolades with their delightful skits, many of which 
        starred a popular and zany Parker Smith. Herbert Duncan and his Sunday 
        School orchestra were usually in attendance with Ethel Caldwell (Mrs. 
        C. Dale) or Grace Chapman (Mrs. T. Davies) at the piano. Anniversary suppers 
        also called for the use of the stage. Following the required number of 
        sittings in the limited space of the basement. the diners moved upstairs 
        to be en-tertained with a concert. During this period, the choir had a 
        creditable membership of about thirty sing-ers and under the direction 
        of C.A McRory, presented concerts and cantatas popular with the congregation. 
        Cantatas were presented also in later years under the direction at different 
        times of Ivy Hewis, Sybil Ross and Grace Davies. The productions were 
        ultimately abandoned when audiences became too small to warrant the work 
        involved in preparing and presenting them.</p>
      <p>The Rev. James Robinson came to the Wesley pulpit in 1931 and remained 
        for nine years. With the busy life of the church continuing through the 
        tenure of Rev. Robinson- the concerts, the church suppers, morning and 
        evening services each Sunday with Sunday School sessions in the afternoon, 
        it would seem surprising that the financial picture was not more encouraging. 
        Although interest appeared to be at a peak with the Sunday School now 
        showing a membership of 112 with 14 teachers, and the Eas-ter service 
        of 1934 registering an attendance of 114 - the largest number to observe 
        Communion in the church's history to that date-and several church organizations 
        functioning, 2 a nagging stewardship problem and a falling off of enthusiasm 
        during the latter years of the decade caused serious concern in re-sponsible 
        circles. It was reported at the annual meeting of the congregation on 
        December 28, 1938, that a deficit of $735 existed, $265 of which represented 
        the unpaid portion on a Bank of Nova Scotia note for money borrowed earlier 
        in the year to cover the previous years debts. By April, 1940, indebtedness 
        had risen to the sum of $949.96, at which time Rev. Robinson left Wesley 
        in answer to another call. In ex-pressing its regret at his leaving and 
        appreciation of his efforts at Wesley, the congregation voiced its dis-appointment 
        that those efforts had not met with the success its members had so much 
        anticipated. The same month, the trustees were empowered to raise a one 
        thousand dollar mortgage which they did in June; with a repayment rate 
        of about twenty-two dollars per month.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 14</b></p>
      <p>At least one outstanding event took place during the pastorate of Rev. 
        Robinson. The church acquired a used electrified Dominion organ in 1936 
        valued at $475, of which $88.40 was still unpaid in 1940. A plaque originally 
        affixed to the organ and presently displayed on the east wall of the narthex 
        near the main entrance, indicates the instrument's dedication to the memory 
        of Robert J. Waterman, an original member and pioneer of Wesley. Organist 
        at the time was Ethel (Mrs. C.) Dale.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it was because a new church was not seen as ever being a part 
        of Wesley's future, or possibly the thinking was to clear the church of 
        debt simply to survive, but on December 14, 1937, the Trustees considered 
        selling the unused portion of the lot next to the church. They placed 
        a value of $2,500 for a lot 90 ft. deep with a 40 ft. frontage on Main 
        Street, or $4,500 for a 90 foot square 10t.3 By this time, Ottawa East 
        had become a much more heavily populated area. Property values were increasing 
        and business eyed Wesley's large vacant corner lot as a highly desirable 
        commercial site. Sun Oil Company and Dominion Stores, Ltd. both expressed 
        interest in the property and in 1940, the Trustees came very close to 
        selling when the following letter was written to a local real estate agent:</p>
      <p>Mr. L. Lemoine 444 Kent Street</p>
      <p>Dear Sir:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>We hereby authorize you as our agent, to sell part of our lands being 
          the north west corner of Main Street and Graham Avenue in Otta-wa East, 
          size being 90 feet on Main by 75 feet on Graham Avenue for the sum of 
          three thousand dollars. We agree to pay you a commission of 5% on this 
          price or any other price we might accept.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>(signed) B.W. Carmpsall,</p>
      <p>sec. Trustee Bd. 4</p>
      <p align="center"><b>VII</b></p>
      <p>Following the departure of Rev. James Robinson, the Rev. W.H. Cramm served 
        as pastor. He was not a young man but he was a very dedicated and resourceful 
        one. Robert Carson's narrative explains:</p>
      <p>&quot;...he came to Wesley in a time of trouble, close to $1,200 in debt,l<br>
        the remnants of a depleted congregation, deserted by responsible offi-cials	
        During his short term as minister-although well advanced in years - by 
        his active administration, the debts were paid; the congrega-tion restored 
        to a healthy condition...&quot;</p>
      <p>In July of 1941, Rev. Cramm somehow managed to acquire one hundred dollars 
        from the United Church Ministerial Association of Ottawa to apply against 
        the mortgage and in May of the following</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Page 15</b></p>
      <p>year, a special appeal netted $135 for the same cause. The Women's Association 
        provided the additional two hundred dollars to allow the final payment 
        to be made on April 8, 1942.2 Wesley Church was now just about thirty-three 
        years old and its second mortgage burning ceremony took place on May 5, 
        1942. Once again the president of the W.A-this time Mrs. 1. Thompson-torched 
        the document and hardly had the ashes cooled, when an estimate to rewire 
        the church and replace the front doors was sought. The rewire job was 
        let in 1942, and Rev. Cramm gave up the Wesley pulpit in 1943.</p>
      <p>The first whisperings of a new, larger church for the Wesley congregation 
        were evident at its annual meeting of January 24, 1944. Mr. Clark McLeod 
        moved that the congregation attempt to raise five hundred dollars to begin 
        a trust fund to build another church sometime in the future. Seconded 
        by Archie McWade, the matter was referred to the Official Board; for what 
        purpose is not explained. However, the Committee of Stewards, acting upon 
        a suggestion by Mr. McLeod, named a three-member subcommittee to serve 
        as trustees of a proposed Building Trust Fund. Appointed to the committee 
        were Clark McLeod, Robert Carson and Archibald McWade.</p>
      <p>As in the case of the first world war, church records make little mention 
        of the 1939-45 war, al-though there did exist a volunteer ladies' group 
        who called themselves the War Service Unit. The members supplied knitted 
        goods such as sweaters, socks and scarves to Canadian troops overseas 
        and supported the Red Cross and other agencies in war relief. On a church-wide 
        scale, there was in April, 1946, an &quot;at home&quot; in the form of 
        a supper held to honour those men and women who had served in the armed 
        forces during the global conflict. Among those receiving such recognition 
        was a newcomer to the church in the person of Mr. Philip McCready, veteran 
        of the Royal Canadian Air Force and as of six months, pastor at Wesley. 
        Mr. McCready, a young, personable ministry student, had great appeal to 
        the congregation. He enjoyed a loyal following, particularly among the 
        younger members and was a welcome catalyst within the currently flourishing 
        Young People's Union and church related social groups like Club 13, an 
        organization made up mainly of choir members and their friends who visited 
        each other's homes and enjoyed the music of the host's record library. 
        The four years of Philip McCready's association with Wesley were relatively 
        'comfortable' years. Church groups were generally well attended as were 
        Sunday services. Finances, always a concern, were not the headache they 
        had been a short time ago. The job Rev. Cramm had started in rejuvenating 
        the spirit of the congregation by throwing off its burden of debt, Mr. 
        McCready continued simply through his outgoing personality, his sincerity, 
        and genuine concern for the interests and problems of any, young or old, 
        who approached him.</p>
      <p><br>
        By 1948, the church organ had aged another twelve years. Visiting organists, 
        if they were polite, simply said nothing about the instrument. Any who 
        were frank in their appraisals, however, complained of its many faults 
        and shortcomings. The time had come to seek a replacement and a special 
        meeting of the congregation was held June 23, 1948 to discuss the matter. 
        It was agreed that a new organ be purchased. A new church was becoming 
        more and more a subject of conversation, although still a picture on a 
        somewhat distant horizon. Nonetheless, it was felt that should a new building 
        become a reality, it would already have its organ. We have described in 
        positive terms the interest and support of the congregation toward its 
        church during the period, yet that enthusiasm seemed to be lacking among 
        those at-tending that particular meeting - perhaps because of the possibility 
        of having to find a large sum of money to realize a desire. It was decided 
        to set up a committee to find ways and means of financing a new organ. 
        It was only after seven members had refused to serve on such a committee 
        that George Chap-man volunteered to do so. He was joined by Joan Duncan 
        and Philip McCready. As one means of rais-ing money for the fund, Mr. 
        Chapman produced a number of wooden banks modelled after the organ to 
        be purchase, an idea used in 1919 by the Sunday School's young men's class 
        to purchase a piano.<br>
