    <td>Every annual report was signed by at least the Trustees of the School 
      Board. The names indicate the various political powers in the village.<br>
      <br>
      John Hughes and Thomas Angel signed the 1889 audit. Hughes was a 45-year-old 
      clerk with the civil service; born in Gibraltar of Irish descent; living 
      on Centre St. (Concord); and a staunch Roman Catholic. He later emerges 
      as the leader and first trustee of the newly formed Ottawa East Separate 
      School Board. As there were no real Catholic schools at the time, students 
      of this religion attended the public system. As their numbers grew, Hughes 
      petitioned for their own school.<br>
      <br>
      Thomas Angel was a 50-year-old postal worker living on Fifth St. (Harvey); 
      born in England of an Italian father and an Anglican. Together these men 
      had 3 school-age children.<br>
      <br>
      The 1890 account lists signatures of Trustees, the Principal and George 
      Tomlinson. The latter, a carpenter living on the Macadamized Road had won 
      the contract to build the new brick school. He moved into the community 
      during that year. Alex Graham, the 24-year-old son of the wealthy John Graham 
      was a Trustee and owner of the Graham Brickworks. Interestingly he did not 
      get the brick contract for the school. All the children of the Lees, Ballantyne 
      and Graham families were either home schooled or sent to private teaching.<br>
      <br>
      Niles G. Ross the 41-year-old &quot;Principal&quot; of the school also signed. 
      Why he had this authority is unknown but a few years later he led a revolt 
      against the village Triad of Lees, Ballantyne and Graham was immediately 
      fired. He had crossed Robert Lees the village patriarch and was sent packing 
      along with his wife.<br>
