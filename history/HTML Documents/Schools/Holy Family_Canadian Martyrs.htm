      <p>Ottawa East educational facilities in the late 1890's were sparse to 
        say the least. As described in the introduction, the only school in the 
        village was SS#17 located on Centre St. (Concord) at Fifth St. (Harvey) 
        and this was decidedly inadequate in meeting the needs of local children. 
      </p>
      <p>All students, no matter what their language or religion, attended the 
        same school. This was a time in the history of Ontario education when 
        a political battle raged over the issue of funding for language or religious-based 
        schools. By 1900, with 105 Catholic families in the village, (55 French-Canadian 
        and 50 Irish-Canadian)<b><font size="1"> 1</font></b>, the demand for 
        separate schooling in the village reached a peak. Led by Bernard Slattery, 
        a powerful businessman and John Hughes, a past member of the Public School 
        Board, a process was set in motion to create a separate school system. 
        And as usual in times such as this, the Catholic community turned to the 
        Oblates (OMI) for support.</p>
      <p>At the request of Thomas Duhamel, Archbishop of Ottawa, the Oblates held 
        a meeting of<a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_RCSB%20Minutes.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_RCSB%20Minutes.jpg" width="111" height="135" align="left" alt="Minutes Front Page" border="0" vspace="5" hspace="5"></a> 
        interested Catholics at the Scholasticate on November 11, 1900. Using 
        the legal provisions found in the Education Act (49V, C46, S21) and advice 
        from the Separate School Inspector J. Rochon, a second meeting was convened 
        on November 15, 1901 to duly elect an official body of trustees as a school 
        board. On this date the Roman Catholic School Board of Ottawa East came 
        into existence. It consisted of John Hughes (Chairman), J. Rochon (pro 
        tem), Rev. G. Charlebois (OMI), J. B. St. Laurent, William Bradley, Adolphe 
        Gervais and William Doran. This chronology of formation was recorded in 
        hand by the Board in a &quot;Brief Historical Sketch&quot; which can be 
        seen here (<a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_RCSB%20Brief%20History1.jpg">Page 
        One</a> and <a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_RCSB%20Brief%20History2.jpg">Page 
        Two</a>).</p>
      <p>For those who have read the History Section (<a href="../../history.htm">found 
        here</a>), all of these names will be familiar as these men at one point 
        or another sought political office or worked in the village. Now officially 
        established the group set about to find the necessary funds to build the 
        first school in Ottawa East to provide French and English students with 
        a Catholic education.</p>
      <p>The first order of business was to notify the village council the Roman 
        Catholic School Board existed. A copy of the actual letter of notification 
        has been <a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_RCSB%20Village%20Letter.jpg">reproduced 
        here</a>. By doing this, the village was then obligated to support a separate 
        system of education using the tax system.</p>
      <p><a href="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/ssj_43_Maison_Blanche_c1890.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/sm/ssj_43_Maison_Blanche_c1890_sm.jpg" width="183" height="112" align="left" vspace="4" hspace="4" alt="The White House built c1870" border="0"></a>On 
        December 3 1900 the Board decided to establish a school (to be named Holy 
        Family School) in temporary quarters in the &quot;White House&quot;, a 
        beautiful rustic building located just adjacent to the Scholasticate on 
        the Oblate property. Arrangements were made with the Oblates to prepare 
        two rooms on the second floor. Rent was $5.00/month. The Grey Nuns were 
        enlisted as teachers for two classes, one in French, and the other in 
        English. Arthur Michaud was employed to care for the two new stoves at 
        25 cents/day and 36 desks were ordered.</p>
      <p>The arrangement with the Oblates was intended to be temporary and to 
        last only until June 30 of 1901. That meant funding and property had to 
        found immediately. The Board minutes indicate that various solutions were 
        debated over the next few months until finally they decided to consult 
        Bernard Slattery. He was an influential member of the Catholic community 
        and paid the highest separate school taxes. He made it clear that a school 
        had to be built immediately and that it must be &quot;a first class one&quot;.</p>
      <p>By April arrangement had been made with the Oblates to purchase land 
        on Main St. across from Hazel St. at 6-cents/square foot. The property 
        was 132 feet wide and 170 <a href="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/ssj_44_Holy_Martyrs_side_Main_at_Hazel.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/sm/ssj_44_Holy_Martyrs_side_Main_at_Hazel_sm.jpg" width="171" height="119" align="right" border="0" vspace="3" hspace="3" alt="Holy Martyrs School  built in 1901"></a>feet 
        deep for a total cost of $1,346. The Oblates agreed to underwrite the 
        cost at 5% per year with capital due in 10 years. Funding for the building 
        and related expenses was sought from various sources. It was decided to 
        borrow $5,000 for Rev. C. Gay of Gracefield at 5% per annum for 20 years.</p>
      <p>An Oblate lay Brother, A. Cadieux, who received <a href="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/ssj_45_Holy_Martyrs_School_Main_at_Hazel.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/sm/ssj_45_Holy_Martyrs_School_Main_at_Hazel_sm.jpg" width="182" height="103" align="left" vspace="4" hspace="4" border="0" alt="Holy Martyrs School - built 1901"></a>$15.00 
        for his work, drew up plans for the school. The construction tender was 
        given to J and C Low Contractors and from the 1901 accounts it appears 
        that the total cost of construction was $4,200.</p>
      <p>The school accounts seem to indicate that the building was in use during 
        the fall of 1901. Funds for the year, apart from the $5,000 loan, came 
        from donations, a legislative grant ($64.73), small personal loans and 
        non-resident fees for students (25 cents per month). Expenses were similar 
        to those incurred at the Public School: heating, supplies (1 box of chalk 
        at 10 cents for the entire year!), desks, caretaking (Mrs. C. Valliers 
        was employed at $5.11 per month because she was a widow with children) 
        and 3 crosses for the rooms ($1.20). The Grey Nuns were paid $569 for 
        the year. The actual accounts have been<a href="../Databases/OE%20Roman%20Catholic%20School%20Board%201901.htm"> 
        reproduced here</a>. They offer the reader a unique insight into the operation 
        of a school at this time.</p>
      <p>For the year 1901, the total receipts were $5,425.93, total expenses 
        were $5,633.23, for a deficit of $207.30.</p>
      <p>By the beginning of 1902 the Board was hot on the trail of public funding. 
        The Township of Gloucester was notified that taxes collected from Separate 
        School supporters with children attending Holy Family School must be paid 
        to the Board. Records no longer exist of who these children were but it 
        is logical to conclude that many would have come from the community just 
        east of the Rideau River at Hurdman Bridge. Gloucester took the notification 
        under review. A similar request was made of Nepean Township for those 
        children living in the area south of Riverdale Avenue to Billings Bridge.</p>
      <p>From the outset of the Roman Catholic Board there was constant acrimony 
        with the village council. As the records for the public system indicate 
        (<a href="SS17_Lady%20Evelyn_2.htm">reproduced here</a>), money was in 
        short supply as well. The Annual Court of Revision (see History Section) 
        regularly dealt with issues such as designating certain ratepayers as 
        separate school supporters. </p>
      <p>The public purse was funded in part by taxation of a few industries in 
        the village. Given that the council was almost entirely English and not 
        Catholic, there was very little support for a separate system of education. 
        Therefore taxes derived from these sources were allocated only to the 
        public system. To find a way around this problem the Board made direct 
        appeals to the various businesses to have them consign a portion of their 
        taxes to the Catholics. In 1905 for example the Ottawa East Water Company 
        agreed to consign $1,000 of its assessment to the separate system.</p>
      <p>Throughout its period of existence, the Roman Catholic School Board of 
        Ottawa East employed the Grey Nuns as teachers. In 1902 three Sisters 
        were paid $675 for the academic year. In August of 1905 the first lay 
        person was employed. Miss B. Tobin was contracted to teach Junior English 
        Class at $125 per year. It appears that the Oblates volunteered to teach 
        music and catechism.</p>
      <p>There was rarely any mention of issues of policy, curriculum or discipline. 
        It appears that these matters were left entirely in the hands of the Sisters. 
        One rare recorded example of policy disagreement occurred in January of 
        1905. A contingent of parents complained that year-end &quot;prices&quot; 
        (sic) or awards were only given to top students and that all students 
        should receive recognition. The Board and the teachers felt that doing 
        so would an &quot;ambition killer&quot;. The eventually relented, deciding 
        to award students in the top classes with a trip to Britannia and a treat 
        for the junior classes instead of prizes. Was this an early example of 
        &quot;political correctness&quot;?</p>
      <p>The battle between the Board and the village continued into 1906 with 
        an appeal for relief of the debt incurred with a school debenture used 
        to build the second public school SS#17. The argument was that since the 
        school had now been sold at a price large enough to retire the debenture, 
        separate school supporters should not be taxed for this item. The village 
        council refused and subsequent legal advice indicated that the court would 
        be of no assistance.</p>
      <p>Finally on December 18 1907, the Roman Catholic School Board of Ottawa 
        East ceased to exist as the village was annexed by the City. All of the 
        assets and liabilities were transferred to the Ottawa Separate School 
        Board and the initial chapter of Catholic education in the community came 
        to a close.</p>
      <p>Now, as a school operated by a much larger (and somewhat distant) school 
        board, Holy Family began to suffer reduced funding for repairs and supplies. 
        As well the world of education was going through many profound changes. 
        As the history of the Oblates (<a href="../Scholaticate/Scholasticate_Page_One.htm">found 
        here</a>) chronicles, a split developed in the Catholic community over 
        language. In the 1920's the Oblates of Mary Immaculate divided into two 
        'religious provinces' with the founding of St. Peter's Province for the 
        English-speaking Fathers. The move was later to result in the building 
        of St. Patrick's College and the establishment of Canadian Martyrs Parish. 
      </p>
      <p>French Catholics were not content with the original system at Holy Family 
        and pushed for a separate school for French language training. It is not 
        exactly clear what took place at this time but it appears that an 'unofficial' 
        school was created to teach French-speaking students above the beginner 
        level taught at Holy Family. Classes were held in various locations including 
        the basement of Ste. Famille Church and the town hall. In 1915, fifty 
        taxpayers in Holy Family Parish petitioned the provincial government for 
        a new school for this purpose. Eventually, in 1923, the Graham house (Ardagh 
        Square) on Main St. was purchased and named De Mazenod after the founder 
        of the Oblate Order. In 1933 a modern building was erected on this location. 
        A more complete story of De Mazenod School is <a href="De%20Mazenod.htm">found 
        here</a>.</p>
      <p>Holy Family on Main at Hazel continued to function but the years began 
        to take their toll on the building. The new Parish of Canadian Martyrs 
        was established in 1930 and the name of the school was changed to Canadian 
        Martyrs School. A history of this parish, created to serve the needs of 
        the English-speaking Catholics of Ottawa East, can be <a href="../Churches/CanMartyrs/CanMartyrs_Page_One.htm">found 
        here</a>. Little was done to make changes in the school building and by 
        1938 it was declared to be &quot;obsolete &#133; not suitable for the 
        purpose&quot; by the Ottawa Fire Department. In that year there were 173 
        students and 4 staff in the building. Some improvements were made including 
        an iron fire escape but the school only remained open because the Board 
        could not provide other suitable quarters.</p>
      <p>By September of 1943 there were 185 pupils in 5 classes with an additional 
        class held at St. Patrick's College. On November 8, 1943 the space problem 
        was only made worse when a fire in the boiler room burned the school beyond 
        repair.</p>
      <p>By November 15 students were being shuffled to one class at <a href="SS17_Lady%20Evelyn.htm">Lady 
        Evelyn School</a>, one at Elgin St. School and two at <a href="St_Pats/St_Patricks.htm">St. 
        Patrick's College</a>. The rate was $50 per class per month. Something 
        had to be done. The Board initially considered building on the old site 
        and acquire more land from the Oblates. Their request for more land was 
        quickly rebuffed and in fact, the Oblates repurchased the land they originally 
        owned for $3,500. For a time building lots on Main St. between Hazel and 
        Glenora were considered in response to parents south of Clegg St. not 
        wanting a more northerly the location for the new school. Ultimately the 
        Board decided to build on the Graham property that had been purchased 
        from the Oblates. The property was originally two lots divided by Claverhouse 
        Ave. The road ran north to south from Graham to the present-day Canadian 
        Martyrs parking lot and was officially closed by court order in 1924.</p>
      <p>Tenders were issued in June of 1944 for a 6-room school to accommodate 
        approximately 200 students. By 1945, the plan was revised to accommodate 
        230 students in 8 rooms at a cost of $84,930. Henry J. Morin of Elgin 
        St. was selected as the architect. At this point the only obstacle in 
        the way of the new school was the Second World War.</p>
      <p>Any new construction during this time period had to be approved by the 
        Controller of Construction at the Department of Munitions and Supply. 
        The reason for this was the shortage of structural steel need for the 
        war effort. Despite numerous impassioned letters from the Board outlining 
        the urgent need to house students, the building was delayed yet again.</p>
      <p>Finally, in the fall of 1947 Canadian Martyrs School was opened under 
        the leadership of Principal Celia Rowan. It went on to serve the needs 
        of the Ottawa East community for decades providing a special opportunity 
        for young people, who in conjunction with the adjacent church, could worship 
        and study within walking distance of their homes. The rich history of 
        the modern school is best left to other sources but a brief chronicle 
        of school life in the original building can be <a href="../Churches/CanMartyrs/Canmar11.htm">found 
        here</a>. Written for the 60th Anniversary of Canadian Martyrs Parish, 
        it details many of the memories held by early residents of Ottawa East. 
        The School eventually ceased to exist as an elementary and secondary institution 
        but it is still standing and now serves as an Adult Education Center.</p>
