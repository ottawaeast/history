      <p>The newest school in Ottawa East opened in the old St. Pat's building 
        in September of 1994. Immaculata High School first began as a girls-only 
        institution in central Ottawa. As the story below relates, it has survived 
        the many changes in education over the decades and now occupies a prominent 
        place in the Ottawa East community. With an enrollment of 1,023 students 
        and 95 staff (2004), the school has breathed new life into the area much 
        as the original St. Pat's did when it opened in 1929</p>

    <td colspan="2">Immaculata High School opened in September, 1928 at 211 Bronson 
      Ave., Ottawa - at the corner of Bronson Ave. and Lisgar St. For some years 
      there had been a need for a Catholic High School for girls which would provide 
      quality education for the daughters of families of moderate incomes. Dr. 
      John J. O'Gorman, pastor of Blessed Sacrament Parish, was one of the leaders 
      in the campaign for the new school; which also had the support of the English 
      priests of Ottawa. The newly founded order (1926) Grey Sisters of the Immaculata 
      Conception, Pembroke, Ontario, were asked to undertake the task of building, 
      organizing and staffing the new school. The Christie property on Bronson 
      Ave., extending from Lisgar Street to Nepean Street and about 1/3 of the 
      block along both Lisgar and Nepean Streets, was purchased as the site for 
      the school. The<br>
      grey stone &quot;Christie Mansion&quot; on the property - a large house 
      with gardens - became the first Immaculata Convent, home to the Grey Sisters 
      who taught in the school. 
      <p>The school was designed by the architect Knoffke<b><font size="4">*</font></b>, 
        who later planned the French Embassy on Sussex Drive. This, the original 
        building, comprised eight large classrooms, a science laboratory, a home 
        economics room, a gymnasium/auditorium with a stage and office space. 
        The building was linked to the Convent by a passageway.</p>
      <p>Until the new building was completed, students attended classes at S1. 
        Patrick' s Home - situated at that time at the corner of Laurier Ave. 
        and Kent Street (site of today's Centennial Towers Office Complex). When 
        the first classes were held at Immaculata, students carried their chairs 
        to the new premises, from St. Patrick's Home. Sister Agnes of the Sacred 
        Heart was appointed principal. She was assisted by Sister Loyola and<br>
        Sister St. Geraldine. .</p>
      <p>Immaculata was established as a Private School. The students wore uniforms 
        and paid reasonable, monthly fees. Later the grade 9 and 10 classes came 
        under the jurisdiction of the Ottawa Separate Board. However, no student 
        was ever deprived of an education for lack of money to pay fees. Many 
        graduates repaid the cost of their education when they were employed. 
        Over the years there were several campaigns sponsored by the archdiocese 
        of Ottawa to aid in the extension and upkeep of the school.</p>
      <p>During the 1930' s and continuing until the mid 1940' s Grade 9 and Grade 
        10 classes were also taught at Immaculata College, 312 Laurier Ave. East 
        (now head quarters of the St. John's Ambulance Association). These girls 
        joined the classes at the main building for special events, assemblies, 
        concerts. They transferred to the classes at the Bronson Ave. site for 
        Grades 11, 12 and 13.</p>
      <p>By the late 1940's the student population had grown; the original school 
        was becoming too small. Hence, the Kearns Memorial wing was built and 
        opened in September 1950. A bequest from the estate of Dr. B. Kearns added 
        eight classrooms including a double-sized commercial class area and space 
        for a --music department. Two years later, this wing was completed by 
        the addition of a top storey containing three classrooms and a library. 
        Continued growth in the student population led to the construction in 
        1963 of the chapel-auditorium wing containing two classrooms, new commercial 
        classrooms, a home economics sewing room, a modem science laboratory, 
        office space and the 910 seat Chapel-Auditorium. The original convent 
        was demolished to provide space for this addition to the school. . (New 
        Convent quarters had been constructed at the corner of Bronson Ave. and 
        Nepean 81. in 1952-53.) At this time the student body reached an all-time 
        high - more than 900 students - all girls - grade 9 to13.</p>
      <p>The final addition to Immaculata - the Separate School Board wing at 
        the corner of Lisgar Street and Percy Street - was opened in September, 
        1967. This area contained five classrooms, a large home economics area, 
        a double gymnasium, a library area, staffroom, nurse's room, and administration 
        offices.</p>
      <p>Several events in the late 1960' s caused a drastic drain in the student 
        population. Immaculata had always had a number of English- speaking students 
        from Hull and Aylmer, Quebec. The fees of these students were paid by 
        the Quebec Government as there was no English Catholic High School for 
        girls in the area. At this time, such an institution was opened in Hull, 
        Quebec. Students who had formerly attended Immaculata now went to this 
        local school. The Immaculata registration dropped. Soon afterward, St. 
        Pius X High School went Co-ed; drawing to it students from Ottawa's West 
        End. As a result, Immaculata' s student population dropped dramatically 
        to around 400 students<br>
        in the early 1970's. </p>
      <p>In 1978, Immaculata went Co-ed in an attempt to survive. Some former 
        graduates had requested that their sons be accepted I as students. There 
        were few male students in these years, but gradually the numbers increased, 
        especially after Grade 7 and Grade 8 students joined the Immaculata student 
        body in the early 1980's. The reception of Provincial Grants for grades 
        11,12 and 13 in 1984 gave a needed boost to the school's efforts to continue. 
        By 1989 student numbers had increased once again and in September 1991 
        a new era began for Immaculata as it took up residence in its present 
        premises on Main Street.</p>
      <p>From 1928 until the late 1950'S Immaculata was staffed exclusively by 
        the Grey Sisters of the Immaculate Conception. Sister Agnes of the Sacred 
        Heart was followed as principal in 1942 by Sister Mary Christine who held 
        that position for 25 years and under whose guidance most of Immaculata' 
        s growth took place. Later principals were Sr. Lucille Martin, Sr. Anna 
        Clare, Sr. Anne Q'Brien and Sr. Teresa Kelly. In 1987, Mr. Jim Shea was 
        appointed principal. He has been succeeded by Mrs. Mary Durst and Mrs. 
        Evelyn Kelly. Lay teachers joined the sisters on staff in the late 1950's. 
        Today's teaching staff is comprised entirely of laymen and women.</p>
      <p>Immaculata has always encouraged a love of drama among its students. 
        Elocution lessons were introduced in the 1950's. An active drama club, 
        begun under the able leadership of Miss Vera McCloy, continues as an integral 
        part of the school. Early productions included Pride and Prejudice, Anne 
        of Green Gables, and the musicals Brigadoon, Fiddler on the Roof, Oklahoma 
        and Godspell.</p>
      <p>Characteristics of Immaculata training have always been a dedication 
        to learning, reverence for Catholic teachings and a loving, caring staff. 
        These traditions are still being carried on although there are no Grey 
        Sisters on staff at present.</p>
      <p>Truly its history shows that Immaculata is a school with a difference.</p>
