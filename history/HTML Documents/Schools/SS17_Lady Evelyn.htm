      <p align="left">The history of public education in Ottawa East goes back 
        as far as 1850 when the province passed legislation dividing Nepean Township 
        into school sections (SS's) As seen on the map below, the community initially 
        was part of School Section #1, located in the northeastern part of the 
        township. Ratepayers for each of these sections were responsible for maintaining 
        the local school.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_School%20Sections%201850_58.jpg" width="540" height="346" alt="School Sections 1850 - 58"> 
        <br>
        <br>
        While no information has yet been found on the specific school that served 
        Ottawa East, it is clear that most schools of this era were sparse to 
        the say the least. Elliott, in his definitive work &quot;The City Beyond&quot; 
        describes facilities as &quot;rough-hewn and the learning rudimentary)<b><font size="1">(1)</font></b>. 
        Only a few had blackboards and desks consisted of &quot;angled planks 
        that ran along the side walls . . . children sat on benches made of split 
        basswood logs, facing the wall (and stood in the centre of the room between 
        the stove and the teacher's desk to recite lessons&quot;<b><font size="1">(2)</font></b>.<br>
        <br>
        It must be remembered that Nepean was essentially rural at that time. 
        While children were entitled to a basic education, their future lay in 
        a predominantly agricultural community. Most ratepayers therefore did 
        not place a high priority on education and tax support was kept to a minimum. 
        Elliott notes <b><font size="1">(3)</font></b> that the original school 
        for SS#1 was located west of Dow's Lake where the Experimental Farm is 
        today. In 1872 a &quot;substantial, and . . . superior, brick building&quot; 
        was constructed near the present-day Hopewell School. It is not clear 
        however, how many Ottawa East students journeyed to these schools.<br>
        <br>
        By the 1870's the suburbs of Archville and Spenceville (later to become 
        Ottawa East Village) were demanding their own school section and school. 
        While SS#1 had been reduced in size, control of education still lay in 
        the hands of predominantly rural school trustees. And, as noted in the 
        <a href="../../schools.htm">historical overview (found here)</a>, many 
        ratepayers objected to funding the children of the squatter camp along 
        the canal. Led by such notables as James and Thomas Ballantyne, Robert 
        Lees and Archibald Stewart, the community convinced the township to create 
        a new school section - SS#17.<br>
        <br>
        On April 22, 1875 Nepean Township Bylaw No. 243 <b><font size="1">(4)</font></b> 
        was passed and this provided for the borrowing of $800 for a new school 
        house. On April 30, 1875, Bylaw No. 245 <b><font size="1">(5)</font></b> 
        established School Section #17, which included all of Ottawa East from 
        Ann St. (Mann Ave.) to Elliot St. between the Rideau River and the Rideau 
        Canal. The responsibility for the organization of a school committee and 
        construction was given to Thomas and James Ballantyne and Archibald Stewart 
        donated land - familiar names in the history of community.<br>

        school was built on the northeast corner of Centre St. (Concord North) 
        and Fifth St. (Harvey St.) and opened for students in September of 1875. 
        <font size="1"> <b>(6)</b></font> According to an article in the Ottawa 
        Citizen (January 26, 1876), by the end of the year there were 74 students 
        on the register with an average attendance of over 50. The article described 
        the school as a &quot;neat wooden structure, 24 x 20 with 11 feet of ceilings&quot;. 
        <a href="SS17_Newsclip_1876.htm">The full article has been reproduced 
        here</a>.<br>
        <br>
        The register in 1875 noted that there were 74 students with an average 
        daily attendance<a href="../Image%20Library/Buildings/Schools/PA132236.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Buildings/Schools/sm/PA132236sm.jpg" width="190" height="197" align="right" vspace="4" hspace="4" border="0" alt="SS17 on Concord at Harvey c1900"></a> 
        of 50. In 1890, the records of the new Ottawa East Public School Board 
        (OEPSB) showed 77 pupils in the register, &quot;the highest on record&quot;. 
        By today's standards, cramming over 50 children in an uninsulated wooden 
        box&quot; with eleven feet of ceiling&quot; would be deemed criminal. 
        One can only imagine how Miss Hasty, the original teacher in 1875, managed 
        to cope.<br>
        <br>
        By 1890 the conditions of the school had become intolerable and, according 
        to the February 18, 1890 report of the schools inspector &quot;not adequate 
        in any sense&quot;. <a href="SS17_Insp%20Report%20Teach%20Duty.htm">His 
        actual report can be found here along with &quot;Duties of Teachers&quot;</a>. 
        Under threat from the Education Department, the School Board was forced 
        to act immediately.<br>
        <br>
        The Board passed a motion on April 7, 1890 agreeing to build a new brick 
        school. On May 19 tenders were considered and Mr. Tomlinson's bid of $2,497 
        was accepted.<br>
