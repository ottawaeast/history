      London, N.W.S. 
      <p>(Dear President - <br>
        Oct 21/Dec 4/65)</p>
      <p><br>
        I thank you all for inviting me to share from afar, in your celebration 
        today, and only wish I could be with you. I have cherished the memories 
        of my seven years in Canada, ever since I left it in 1911.</p>
      <p>I have always loved your country, and many Canadian friends who enriched 
        my life. Sixty years ago, when this school was born, I was 19, and had 
        the honour of having two things named after roe, as a tribute, of-course, 
        to my father, Lord Grey, then Governor-General. One was a School; the 
        other a broad-beamed, busy little tug-boat on the St. Lawrence river.</p>
      <p>You might have thought that no two things could have 80 little in common. 
        But I wonder.<br>
        Is it not a tug-boat's job to lead, partly by pulling and partly by pushing, 
        a great ship to its anchorage?' And is it not a Junior School's business 
        to lead, again by alternately pulling and pushing, a cargo of young minds 
        into the main stream that will float them to a civilised maturity? We 
        know that the word &quot;Education&quot; means, not &quot;a pulling into&quot;', 
        but a &quot;leading out from.&quot; A school is, or should be, a, place&quot;, 
        where the capacities lying dormant in all young creatures ,are gradually 
        drawn out and developed for use. And for what use? To think; to distinguish 
        good from bad;' to detect what is false and faked; to make .the best of 
        every talent; to be aware of the beauty of the world to be active, cheerful, 
        amused and, if possible, amusing; to make and keep friends; to enjoy things; 
        to grumble as little as possible; to keep an open mind, and, as a consequence, 
        to be happy, even in the difficult, if exciting, world of today.</p>
      <p>It is a lot to ask from a School, but nothing less will really do, and 
        it is with this warmest hope that my Namesake may accomplish- this. that 
        I am</p>
      <p>(Your well wisher and Friend</p>
      <p>Evelyn Jones)</p>
