    <td>For some time now a movement has been on foot to establish a school here. 
      A petition was recently circulated in the village asking Trustee to erect 
      a suitable building for the purpose. They complied and entrusted the locating 
      of the school house to Mr. Jas. Ballantyne, one of their number. Mr. Arch. 
      Stewart generously a lot on which to erect the building, and the use of 
      three others to the school section.<br>
      <br>
      A neat wooden structure, 24 x20 with 11 feet of ceilings, was then erected 
      and furnished at a cost of $800. Mr. Ballantyne was architect, and in fact 
      head and tail of the whole movement. Too great credit can not be given him 
      for his indefatigable exertions or as a vote of thanks passed at the last 
      meeting has it &quot;for his zeal, energy and perseverance in carrying to 
      such a successful the business of this section&quot;.<br>
      <br>
      Miss Hasty was engaged as teacher. At the usual examination before the Christmas 
      holidays, she showed that she was not unworthy of the confidence of the 
      gentleman who engaged her, or of the parents and children, by the progress 
      that the pupils had made in the few short weeks she had had them under her 
      charge.<br>
      <br>
      During last summer a proposition was made to have School Section 1 divided 
      into two parts by lopping off that part known as Archville (late Deep Cut) 
      and constituting it into a new section. This proposition being received 
      with favor by the Council, a By-law was passed making Archville a new school 
      section to be known as No. 17. The By-law came into effect last Christmas 
      day. The Council assumed all the debts and will levy a tax, annually, equal 
      to the amount of the debentures falling due and the interest upon the whole.<br>
      <br>
      At a school meeting in December, Mr. G. H. Fawcett, Mr. Robert Lees and 
      Mr. James Ballantyne were elected Trustees for terms of one, two and three 
      years respectively. At the regular annual meeting held on 12th January the 
      report of the Trustees showed the school to be in healthy condition, the 
      debt having been liquidated and money for the current year's expenses provided, 
      that Miss Hasty was given general satisfaction, and that there were no less 
      than seventy-four names on the register, with an average attendance of over 
      fifty.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Fawcett was re-elected as Trustee and Mr. Greenfield auditor. A vote 
      of thanks was passed to Mr. Stewart for his genuine gift and the meeting 
      adjourned. During the coming summer the land will be enclosed, and then 
      we can present as creditable an appearance as any school section to the 
      county.<br>
