      rustic wood building that sat overlooking the Rideau River on what we know 
      call the Oblate property. The memory of this building, simply referred to 
      by its colour, holds a special place in the hearts of the earliest Catholic 
      residents of the village. Not only was the building the location of the 
      first organized Catholic school but it also served as a church when the 
      parish of Ste. Famille was created at the beginning of the Twentieth Century. 
      And it was the center of many celebrations by the Catholic community for 
      many decades.</td>

    <td colspan="2">Contrary to popular belief though, the house was not built 
      by the Oblate Fathers. This Order first purchased land in September of 1863 
      from Richard Fitzsimmons. There were later transactions between Darby Kealey 
      and Martin O'Gara up to 1883. The Codex Historicus (the official history 
      of the Oblates) indicates that the actual building of the Scholasticate 
      was started about 1884 and that the White House was there when they arrived. 
      Therefore this building was probably constructed by Isaac Fitzsimmons as 
      a home on his large farm on Concession D, Lot H. The actual land record 
      can be seen <a href="../Image%20Library/Documents/D_Land%20Registry%20ConD%20LotH.jpg">here</a>.</td>

    <td colspan="2">There is also some disagreement as to when it was demolished. 
      Again the Codex Historicus lists a request for permission to demolish the 
      house in April of 1927. The request was for immediate action as the building 
      was in an unsafe state. It is therefore logical to assume the demolition 
      occurred shortly thereafter.</td>

    <td colspan="2">Perhaps the best description of La Maison Blanche is that 
      of Augustin Potvin, a very early member of the Ste. Famille Parish. His 
      eloquent phrases demonstrate the special place that this venerated building 
      held in the hearts of all early parishioners. His thoughts were recorded 
      in the Eightieth Anniversary History prepared by the Parish of Ste. Famille 
      (pages 5 to 7) and are reproduced below. The source of the translation is 
      unknown. </td>

      <p><b>The White House by Augustin Potvin</b></p>
      <p>&quot;The White House is nothing more than a memory. But how poetic, 
        how faithful, how vivid. I know that the elderly of Ottawa East shed tears 
        in silence when worn out by the passage of time, the White House was demolished 
        a few years ago. It is a happy page of their life which seems to have 
        been erased forever. It is to perpetuate this devotion that I thought 
        to write these lines. </p>
      <p>Like old people, the White House kept memories of times past and loved 
        to spin yarns about olden times. Its unassuming walls have seen things 
        worthy of being recounted. But why ask questions, let it speak for itself. 
        &quot;I was the birthplace of Holy Family Parish. My walls, which were 
        strong at that time, sheltered the first chapel, the first school and 
        the first parish hall in Ottawa East.&quot; Our readers know without a 
        doubt that up' till 1900, the Catholic families scattered in this area 
        did not have either a separate school or church. In that year, at the 
        request of its principal citizens, the Archbishop of Ottawa, Monseigneur 
        Duhamel, decided to have the Oblate Fathers of St. Joseph's College (the 
        Scholasticate) open a school and to establish a parish there. Father Guillaume 
        Charlebois was named the first parish priest (cure). He set up a school 
        commission which fixed up the top floor where temporary classrooms were 
        installed. The Chairman of this School Board, which functioned until Ottawa 
        East was annexed by the Capital, was Mr. J. Hughes. The Vice-Chairman 
        was Mr. J.B. St. Laurent and the Secretary-Treasurer was Father Guillaume 
        Charlebois who was replaced in the fall of the year by his brother Father 
        Charles Charlebois.</p>
      <p>With great dedication the Grey Sisters of Ottawa took charge of the growing 
        school. As early as 1901, classes were started for children in the English 
        and French language. On the 14th of April of the same year, Holy Family 
        Parish was canonically established. It was the second parish established 
        in the diocese. The west room of the White House was furnished as a temporary 
        chapel and parish offices were said there regularly starting on Easter 
        Sunday, 1901. The eighth of July following, Father Charles Charlebois 
        became cure of the new institution. He stayed almost twelve years as the 
        paster of Holy Family.</p>
      <p>The White House served as a school until September 1901 and as a church 
        until 30 November 1902. It must have been deeply moving, the midnight 
        mass of the 25th of December, 1901, in this rustic setting, where the 
        baby Jesus, would have thought of Bethlehem with the children inviting 
        him so lovingly in their carols to be born in us today.</p>
      <p>Listen again to the voice of the White House: &quot;If I only kept until 
        1902 the honor of housing your chapel, and if I only sheltered your classes 
        for less than a year, I have been for alot longer time a faithful witness 
        of parish festivities. My left wing served as a public<br>
        assembly hall for several years.&quot; What touching words for those, 
        both elderly and not so old, who knew the White House.</p>
      <p>It is there as children we played in skits under the direction of the 
        good Grey Sisters. It is there we learned to love our language. It is 
        there that our elders exercised their talents in drama or comedy. It is 
        there during the New Years season, that a Father or Brother from the Scholasticate 
        disguised as St. Nicholas would distribute fruit and candy in lattice 
        work (net) bags. It is there that our parents came to applaud our success 
        and were amused sometimes by our pranks. It is there, in a word, that 
        each one of us knew moments of unforgettable happiness which we like to 
        recall today.</p>
      <p>The White House is all that we have said and much more. It is the fragile 
        bark canoe that Frere Scholasticat paddled gayly on the Rideau River and 
        that he put away in the right wing. A bit further away it is the priests 
        garden where flowers and fruit grew &quot;like a paradise on earth.&quot; 
        Close by it is the grove where, beads in hand, the religious walked silently, 
        to the song of birds. Finally it is the little cemetary, where piously 
        each day, the Oblates of today came to kneel at the graves of Oblates 
        of former days.</p>
      <p>And if the White House evokes so many charming images, so much quiet 
        devotion, so many hopes and so many dreams, how could we not cherish it, 
        not praise its memory in this the fiftieth year of the Scholasticate near 
        which the White House cast its picturesque silhouette for such a long 
        time. Yes, truly inanimate objects have a soul that binds itself to our 
        own and gives us the will to love.&quot;</p>
