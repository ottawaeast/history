      13 Wellington Court<br>
      St Johns Wood<br>
      N.W.8<br>
      London 
      <p>Oct 7,45</p>
      <p>Dear Brigadier General Winter:<br>
        .<br>
        Will you read this letter for me to the School?</p>
      <p>Your Letter came - like a sudden flash out of the Past -Forty years ago, 
        1 was so proud to have the school named after me; and I am so touched 
        that you should still remember me today, and that my photograph is still 
        hanging on the wall</p>
      <p>I wish that I could be in the hall, personally - instead and see and 
        talk to you all - only no one would recognize the grey haired stranger! 
        Not that I feel 59 - I feel far nearer the girl of 19 who spent 7, lovely 
        happy years in Canada and remember it vividly - like a second home - I 
        should love to come again -perhaps one day I will, and you will let me 
        come and see you al!. I should like that very much.</p>
      <p>We are all very proud in England - of Canada, and of all the Canadians 
        have done and given in this Tremendous Fight. We had a brigade of splendid 
        men billeted in OUT little Market Town and all the people loved them and 
        wished they could stay in Norfolk always.</p>
      <p>And now the war is over; all those who came to help are flooding back 
        to Canada, Australia, South Africa, India, America, Poland, Holland and 
        Norway -</p>
      <p>It is all rather exciting don't you think? that the men and women of 
        each country who cared for Justice and Freedom in which to think and live 
        in kindness and truth should have all left home and crossed the sea to 
        be in a great army fighting against Bad Things together?<br>
        <br>
        You must all make a big resolve now to keep the ways open for splendid 
        ways of living - that each one of us can leave room for the other - and 
        share together instead of competing -always</p>
      <p>My idea of a Happy World; is someone who loves music or carpentering 
        - skating or books, building houses or making dams, nursing - painting 
        sunrises or doing any other thing they love should find their friends 
        in those who understand the same thing whether they are Poles or Canadians 
        Dutch or English French or Norwegian -Sharing Truth and Beauty and the 
        intense delight of being Alive because they &quot;belong&quot; through 
        their Minds -</p>
      <p>You can love your country because it is specially your home -but please 
        love the other countries for through finding out the joyful and beautiful 
        things each one keeps for those who look. Learn every language you can 
        - and do not think French people are No good because they drink coffee 
        while we drink tea, like some silly people I once met in England! You 
        are all growing up and the life people will be living in 1965 will partly 
        be made by you.</p>
      <p>What are you going to do about it? Look for the Best in people - please, 
        in people Everywhere.</p>
      <p>and believe that life is a very exciting adventure. But - it is made 
        by men and women- and children - so each of you matter tremendously and 
        can help make the world delightful - or horrible place -</p>
      <p>I send you all very best wishes for courage and the capacity of &quot;seeing&quot; 
        Happy Things - may Happiness - be yours-<br>
        Your friend<br>
        Evelyn Jones<br>
