          A BRIEF HISTORY OF LADY EVELYN SCHOOL<br>
          written by Caroline Langill</b></p>
      </div>
      <p>Lady Evelyn has a long-standing history in Ottawa East, one that predates 
        1900. The earliest records are from 1889 when the school consisted of 
        one room. Ottawa East was a fast-growing community and the-needs were 
        greater than the small school could offer. In March of 1905 it was decided 
        by the Board of Public School Trustees for Ottawa East, that a &quot; 
        building would be erected on Ella Street that would house the new school.	
        <br>
        .<br>
        On Friday, October 27, 1905, Ottawa East Public School was officially 
        opened by, His Excellency Lord Earl Grey who was' then the Governor General. 
        He was accompanied by his daughter Lady Evelyn Grey, who was presented 
        with a bouquet of red roses at the opening by two young students. On March 
        24, 1908 Major Winter, then Chair of the Board of Trustees requested that 
        Ottawa East Public School be officially renamed Lady Evelyn Public School. 
        This application was granted and soon after the street name Ella Avenue 
        was changed to Evelyn Avenue.<br>
        <br>
        After this initial flurry of activity it was pretty much business as usual 
        at Lady Evelyn. The student population grew until it reached as many as 
        300 in the 1960s. In 1980 things began to look-grim for the 75-year-old 
        school. The enrolment had dipped below 100 'and the Ottawa Board of Education 
        intended to close Lady Evelyn. But people in the neighbourhood were attached 
        to the school. Many who had attended it as children had fond memories 
        of their time there. Closing it would mean &quot;children would have to 
        be bused long distances. A committed group of parents&quot; who were involved 
        with the Parent Pre-school Resource Centre banded together and using <i>To 
        Herald a Child</i>, written by Laurier Lapierre as inspiration, they proposed 
        that Lady Evelyn become an alternative school. This was the first attempt 
        to have an alternative school in the Ottawa area. The challenges seemed 
        to fuel their energy and in 1982 Lady Evelyn Alternative School was established 
        as a pilot project on the condition that seventy-five children were enrolled. 
        The parent's hard work was met with success and since that time the enrolment 
        has increased steadily and the school is now thriving. With the beautiful 
        new facility opened in the school year 1993/94, Lady Evelyn is able to 
        continue its philosophy of self-directed, individualized programming which 
        the principal, parents and teachers share.<br>
