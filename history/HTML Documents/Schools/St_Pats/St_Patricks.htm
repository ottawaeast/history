    <td colspan="2" height="7">The origin of St. Patrick's College can be found 
      in the complex history of the Catholic religion in Ottawa. As seen in the 
      story of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate <a href="../../Scholaticate/Scholasticate_Page_One.htm">(found 
      here)</a>, the division along linguistic lines at the University of Ottawa 
      in the early Twentieth Century culminated with the building of this imposing 
      college on Echo Drive overlooking the canal. 
      <p><a href="../../Image%20Library/Buildings/Schools/CA%204048_StPats.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/Buildings/Schools/sm/CA%204048_StPats_sm.jpg" width="200" height="81" align="left" border="0" alt="St. Pat's c1954"></a>Opened 
        in September 1929, in temporary quarters, the school was originally intended 
        to meet the needs of secondary and post-secondary English-speaking Catholics 
        in the Ottawa area. From the outset St. Pat's played a major role in Ottawa 
        East both in academics and athletics. Today there are thousands of alumnae 
        throughout the world who credit their success in life this unique institution 
        and value still &quot;the indefinable sense of fellowship&quot; that came 
        with the St. Pat's experience.</p>
      <p>Detailing the nearly four decades of school activities would require 
        a separate project in<a href="../../Image%20Library/Buildings/Schools/X_St_Pats_sketch.jpg"><img src="../../Image%20Library/Buildings/Schools/sm/X_St_Pats_sketch_sm.jpg" width="200" height="145" align="right" vspace="5" border="0" alt="Original plans for St. Pat's"></a> 
        itself. It is fortunate though, that H. A. MacDougall wrote an overview 
        of this history in 1982 for the Canadian Catholic Historical Association. 
        <a href="St%20Pats%20Booklet.htm">The monograph has been reproduced here 
        </a>with the kind permission of the Association.</p>
      <p>St. Pat's ceased to exist as a separate Catholic school on July 12, 1967. 
        At this point, it departed from its parent institution, the University 
        of Ottawa, to become a faculty at Carleton University. The school met 
        its final demise on January 31, 1979 when the Board of Governors at Carleton 
        announced that the college would cease to exist in the following academic 
        year.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The building itself of course still stands magnificently overlooking 
        the Rideau Canal. For a time it was a campus of Algonquin College and 
        presently houses Immaculata High School. As such, the building originally 
        constructed on Patterson's Field, continues to daily bring hundreds of 
        young vibrant minds to Ottawa East and thereby continues the legacy.</p>
