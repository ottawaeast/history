      <p>The beginnings of De Mazenod Separate School are found in the creation 
        of the first separate school in Ottawa East. In 1900 the Catholic community 
        of Ottawa East formed the new Parish of Ste. Famille (Holy Family) and 
        in 1901 created the Ottawa East Roman Catholic School Board. By 1902 a 
        new church and school had been built. There is much more on this story 
        in the history of <a href="Holy%20Family_Canadian%20Martyrs.htm">Holy 
        Family School found here</a>. </p>
      <p>Initially both French and English Catholics worshipped and studied together 
        in Ottawa East. At the end of the first decade of the Twentieth Century 
        however, there was a growing demand for a separate institution for the 
        teaching in the French language. It appears that an 'unofficial' school 
        existed at this time for senior level French students that could not be 
        accommodated at the Holy Family School. In 1915 fifty taxpayers in the 
        area petitioned the provincial government for assistance in acquiring 
        acceptable space for these classes. Little was done to attenuate the situation, 
        as there was opposition to expansion of the separate system. </p>
      <p>Finally in 1923, under the leadership of Trustee Beaudry, the Separate 
        School Board acquired the property at the southwest corner of Main and 
        Graham. Records indicate that the Oblates of Mary Immaculate had originally 
        purchased the property from the Graham Estate and sold it to the school 
        board for $38,000. The land included lots 28 to 40 on Reg. Plan 90280. 
        The Grahams had called this land &quot;Ardagh Square&quot;.</p>
      <p>The school opened in the Graham home on Friday, November 9, 1923 with 
        60 students attending. The original suggestion for a name was St. Michel 
        but the school board felt that the role of the Oblates in purchasing the 
        land be recognized. As a result the school was named after Saint Eugene 
        De Mazenod, the founder of the Oblate Order.</p>
      <p>The school functioned in this location until 1933 when the contractor 
        H. Dagenais built the new structure at the same location. It is not clear 
        as to when the school ceased operation but the building has had a storied 
        history over the past two decades with many different uses.</p>

      <p>(Editor's Note: Unlike the other schools described in this history, there 
        was very little information available about De Mazenod's history. Hopefully 
        someone will fill this gap in the future.)</p>
