      <p><b>Beginnings . . .</b> </p>
      <p>Eugene of Mazenod was born in Aix-en-Provence in France in1782, the son 
        of a wealthy aristocratic parents. His father Charles Antoine de Mazenod, 
        a member of the French nobility was the President of the Aix Parliament. 
        His mother Marie-Rose Joannis, a member of the rapidly evolving bourgeois 
        merchants embodied the practical and shrewd realism of this group. This 
        union of complementary social and cultural values assured young Eugene 
        all the requisites for a successful and comfortable life. This idyllic 
        world was swept away by the French Revolution in 1789. After his father 
        opposed the revolution, the entire family was obliged to flee into exile 
        in Italy. In 1790, a new painful period began for Eugene.These were years 
        of family instability, material scarcity and danger.The family was forced 
        to flee successively to Turin, Venice, Naples and Palermo.</p>
      <p><img src="../../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/OMI/SJ5_Eugenechild.jpg" align="left" width="234" height="325" alt="Eugene De Mazenod as a young boy" border="0" hspace="5"> 
        Eugene's adolescence was impoverished. Deprived of friends of his own 
        age, unable to continue an orderly academic program, he was also separated 
        from his mother who divorced her husband in order to return and reclaim 
        family property in France.</p>
      <b>Coming of age . . . </b> 
      <p>Eugene was 20 years old when he returned from exile. Upon arrival in 
        France, his overriding desire was to live fully, to make up for lost time. 
        Young, handsome, with a well known family name he also had the inherited 
        wealth recovered by his mother. Among his head-strong ambitions and pretensions: 
        Marriage with a young rich heiress, a secure and prestigious position 
        in society and access to the pleasures and amusements of the good life.. 
      </p>
      <p align="justify">These dreams crumbled one by one starting with the unexpected 
        death of the wealthy young woman. Eugene now 25 years old was forced to 
        make a new balance of his life and person. He was not the extraordinary 
        man that he had imagined himself to be. Certainly he had some good qualities, 
        a strong character and a generous heart. Yet it was also obvious that 
        he had yet to accomplish anything truly important. Superficial friendships 
        and the easy pleasures of high society living were found empty and wanting. 
      </p>
      <p align="justify"> Little by little the social and moral havoc resulting 
        from the French Revolution had profoundly impacted on Eugene. He was moved 
        by the distressing condition of the clergy and the tremendous religious 
        ignorance of the people found everywhere. Endowed with a lively and imperious 
        character and filled with noble intentions, Eugene resolved to play a 
        part in meeting the urgent needs of the Church.</p>
      <b>Initial steps of a Spiritual Journey</b> 
      <p align="justify">Eugene de Mazenod&#146;s spiritual journey and personality 
        were profoundly influenced by his family&#146;s values and struggles amidst 
        the insecurity and ambiguity of the Italian exile. During his time of 
        exile in Venice (1794-1797), a holy priest, Don Bartolo Zinelli, introduced 
        him to the spirituality of the Company of Jesus. From him as a young boy, 
        Eugene learned how to pray and how to practice mortification. Don Bartolo 
        also initiated him to a devotion to the Virgin Mary "It was there", Eugene 
        would later write, "that my vocation to the priesthood was born". </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Special Graces</font></b></p>
      <p align="justify">Two interior graces transformed Eugene in his twenties. 
        The first was a grace of "conversion". During the adoration of the cross 
        on Good Friday in 1807, Eugene had a special experience of the love and 
        goodness of Christ which culminated in the shedding of his blood to obtain 
        the forgiveness of all sins. Simultaneously conscious of his own sins 
        and filled with a sense of profound confidence in Divine Mercy, Eugene 
        decided to make amends through the total gift of his life to Jesus his 
        Savior. </p>
      <p align="justify"><img src="../../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/OMI/SJ15_Eugeneyoungpriest.jpg" width="167" height="230" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">A 
        second moment of grace, which he describes as "an impulse from without" 
        from the Spirit , led him to a decision for the priesthood. In 1808, he 
        would enter the Seminary of Saint Sulpice in Paris and be ordained a priest 
        at Amiens, on December 21, 1811. His dream was to be "the servant and 
        priest of the poor".</p>
      <p><b>Seminary Formation</b> </p>
      <p align="justify">From 1808 to 1812 as a member of the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice 
        in Paris, Eugene de Mazenod was guided by Monsieur Emery and Monsieur 
        Duclaux. These holy men encouraged Eugene to continue developing a spirit 
        of fervor, regularity and industrious ness. Eugene, notwithstanding personal 
        risk, committed himself to faithfully serve and assist the Pope who at 
        this time was a prisoner of Napoleon at Fontainebleau. </p>
      <p align="justify">Eugene's desire to become a priest of the poor continued 
        to develop. Direct contact with impoverished youth and prisoners of war 
        strengthened Eugene&#146;s desire to devote himself entirely to these 
        forgotten people. Simultaneously he continued to harbor a desire to make 
        atonement, both for his own sins and all Christians who had abandoned 
        the Church. Thus he participates in the activities of the Marian Congregation 
        and a missionary group established by his friend and confrere Charles 
        de Forbin-Janson. Repeatedly he expressed the desire to cooperate with 
        Christ in the salvation of the world, so that the shedding of the blood 
        of Christ might be efficacious for others as it had been for him.</p>
      <p><b>A Missionary Community Is Born</b> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Eugene began his ministry by rejecting a prestigious diocesan position 
        to reach out to the poor , the workers, the youth, the sick and the imprisoned 
        of Aix Overwhelmed by the demands and possibilities of this ministry, 
        he soon realized that he needed to gather a group of zealous priests to 
        work with him. The goal: to awaken "a faith that had all but died in the 
        hearts of so many".</p>
      <p align="justify">In September 1815, he experienced another "impulse from 
        without" that set him firmly on the path of apostolic action. He gave 
        himself body and soul to the realization of his plans to establish a society 
        of missionaries. On January 25, 1816, the society of the Missionaries 
        of Provence was born. </p>
      <p align="justify">Father de Mazenod invited his companions "to live together 
        as brothers" and "to imitate the virtues and examples of our Saviour Jesus 
        Christ, above all through the preaching of the Word of God to the poor". 
        He urged them to commit themselves unreservedly to the work of the missions, 
        binding themselves by religious vows. Because of their small number, they 
        initially limited their zeal to the neighboring countryside. Their fondest 
        wish, however, was "to embrace the vast expanse of the whole earth", as 
        the founder had written in 1818. </p>
      <p align="justify"><img src="../../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/OMI/SJ18_OblateShield.jpg" width="267" height="275" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">Pope 
        Leo XII on February 17, 1826 formally approved the newly founded Congregation 
        of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. Its motto: "He has sent 
        me to evangelize the poor" expressed both its charism and way of life. 
      </p>
      <p><b>Eugene's Struggles and Spiritual Growth</b> </p>
      <p align="justify">During his first years as a priest, Eugene continually 
        struggled to find a balance in his life between prayer and service to 
        others.</p>
      <p align="justify">After a series of initial successes, there was a period 
        of deep and painful purification. From 1827 to 1836, Eugene was tested 
        time and time again: conflicts, defections, bereavements, temporary loss 
        of his French citizenship, even suspicion from the Holy See. Along with 
        making him seriously ill, these events led to moments of discouragement 
        and depression. Eugene discovered, first hand, the cost of discipleship 
        and service of the Church. He came out of this experience bruised and 
        humbled, more understanding towards others and much stronger in his love 
        and faith. </p>
      <p><b>Bishop of Marseille</b> </p>
      <p align="justify">The Diocese of Marseille had been re-established in 1823.. 
        After a period as Vicar General of this diocese, in 1837, Eugene was named 
        Bishop of Marseille.As pastor of a Church undergoing a time of significant 
        growth and simultaneously Superior of a fledgling group of missionaries, 
        Bishop Eugene de Mazenod truly had to be "all things to all people". As 
        Bishop, Eugene greatly increased the number of parishes and religious 
        associations in the diocese. He not only welcome the return of Religious 
        institutes such as the Jesuits, but also personally encouraged the founding 
        of several new religious families. </p>
      <p align="justify"><img src="../../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/OMI/SJ4_ChurchdelaGare.jpg" width="274" height="200" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">Special 
        programs were undertaken for youth, workers, immigrants and the needy 
        in rapidly developing port city of Marseille. The construction of a new 
        cathedral, the shrine of Notre Dame was initiated. Simultaneously he played 
        a prominent role in the in the major political and religious questions 
        of the day such as religious education and the rights of the papacy. In 
        1854, he journeyed to Rome to participate enthusiastically in the proclamation 
        of the Immaculate Conception on December 8. </p>
      <p><b>The mature Apostolic Man</b> </p>
      <p align="justify">As bishop in Marseilles, Eugene de Mazenod was at his 
        full spiritual maturity. An untiring and zealous pastor, solidly anchored 
        in the love of Christ and of the Church. Forgetful of self, he focused 
        all his energies on the task of evangelization entrusted to him, both 
        in Marseilles and beyond. During this time of intense ministry he remained 
        a man of prayer. </p>
      <p align="justify">The Eucharist was his source of inspiration and renewal. 
        He insisted on celebrating Mass daily, sometimes at great inconvenience, 
        particularly while traveling. The Eucharist, his privileged place of identification 
        with Christ was also the space for gathering together friends and members 
        of his religious family. As he himself said, the Eucharist was in fact 
        "their living center of communication". There he remembered his missionary 
        sons, particularly those far away, and he asked them to do likewise. "While 
        identifying ourselves with Jesus Christ, we shall be at one with him, 
        and by him and in him we shall be at one among ourselves". </p>
      <p><br>
        <b>Superior General and Missionary</b> </p>
      <p align="justify">All the while, Eugene continued to serve as Superior 
        General of the Oblates. After accepting a mission in neighboring Corsica 
        en 1834, starting in 1841, the small Society began a period of great expansion. 
        Eugene received many requests from abroad. In spite of limited personnel, 
        he responded in faith. In 1841 the first Oblates arrived in Canada . Soon 
        they ventured into the vast plains of the West and within a few years 
        had reached the Arctic Circle. Other countries followed: England in 1842; 
        the United States and Ceylon (today Sri Lanka) in 1847, South Africa in 
        1851 and Ireland in 1855. </p>
      <p align="justify"><img src="../../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/OMI/SJ14_Eugeneyoungblue.jpg" width="215" height="275" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">Always 
        a prolific writer, Eugene corresponded unceasingly with his missionaries. 
        In his voluminous correspondence he reveals himself as a caring pastor, 
        involved in all aspects of their life and mission. Always an apostolic 
        man, he was able to encourage, advise, correct and support. He harbored 
        a profound sense of spiritual paternity and lived in intense union with 
        his sons as they shouldered the many heavy burdens in distant missions. 
        Although he never traveled beyond the borders of Europe, with the exception 
        of a short trip to Algeria, Saint Eugene nurtured in his heart a concern 
        for all the churches. A visiting bishop remarked after meeting Saint Eugene: 
        &#147;I have met the apostle Paul&#148;. </p>
      <p><b>His Spiritual Horizons</b> </p>
      <p align="justify">De Mazenod's most basic attitude before humanity is one 
        of trust and faith. Two very solid convictions explain this attitude. 
        First: everything which occurs on earth, on the personal as well as the 
        civil and social level, depends on Divine Providence. Second: God wants 
        all to be saved, and all, both rich and poor, have been purchased by the 
        blood of Christ.</p>
      <p align="justify">In his pastoral letters, he emphasizes the following 
        points:</p>
      <p align="justify"><i>All are called to salvation and holiness</i>. He proposes 
        to the Oblates: &#147;We must strive first of all to lead people to act 
        like human beings, and then like Christians, and finally, we must help 
        them to become saints. </p>
      <p align="justify"><i> To remain on the road to sanctity and make progress, 
        Christians should look upon themselves with the eyes of faith. </i> No 
        matter how poor or destitute they might be, in the eyes of faith all are 
        &#147;children of God&#148; &#147;brothers and sisters of Jesus Christ&#148; 
        and &#147;heirs of His eternal kingdom.&#148; </p>
      <p align="justify"><i> Holiness consists in conversion of heart, fidelity 
        to the law of God and to the inspiration of his grace, in the knowledge 
        and love of Jesus Christ. </i> To love the Jesus Christ is to love the 
        Church. </p>
      <p align="justify"><i> The journey to holiness demands a constant ongoing 
        conversion </i></p>
      <p><b>Oblate Constitutions and Rules</b> </p>
      <p align="justify"><img src="../../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/OMI/SJ10_Eugeneoldblue.jpg" width="200" height="271" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">Saint 
        Eugene's spiritual synthesis is found most clearly in the <i>Rules and 
        Constitutions </i>of his Institute. These reflect both his own personal 
        experience and the perception of the needs of the day.When writing the 
        Oblate Constitutions, Saint Eugene borrowed copiously from Sulpician and 
        Jesuit mentors as well as missionaries he admired such as Charles Borromeo, 
        Vincent de Paul, and Alphonsus de Liguori.</p>
      <p align="justify"> The Constitutions reflect his unique personality and 
        Gospel rootedness. "<i>The spirit of total devotion for the glory of God, 
        the service of the Church and the salvation of souls is the spirit proper 
        to our Congregation"</i>, he wrote in 1817. He further stated, in 1830, 
        that we must look upon ourselves "<i>as the servants of the Father of 
        a family commanded to succor, to aid, to bring back his children by working 
        to the utmost, in the midst of tribulations, of persecutions of every 
        kind, without claiming any reward other than that which the Lord has promised 
        to faithful servants who have worthily fulfilled their mission</i>". </p>
      <p><br>
        <b>Words to the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;<img src="../../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/OMI/SJ17_Oblatemadonna.jpg" width="175" height="413" align="left" border="0" hspace="5">Towards 
        the end of his life, Eugene had become very free. Faced with the prospect 
        of the cardinalate which had been promised and which slipped away from 
        him because of political considerations, he had this to say: "<i>After 
        all, it is all the same whether one is buried in a red cassock or a purple 
        one; the main thing is that the bishop gets to heaven</i>".</p>
      <p align="justify"> Shortly before his death on May 21, 1861, in keeping 
        with his temperament, the elderly and seriously ill bishop said to those 
        around him: "Should I happen to doze off, or if I appear to be getting 
        worse, please wake me up! I want to die knowing that I am dying". </p>
      <p align="justify">His last words to the Oblates were a testament that summed 
        up his life: "Practice well among yourselves charity, charity, charity, 
        and outside, zeal for the salvation of souls". Saint Eugene died on Pentecost 
        Sunday to the prayer of the <i>Salve Regina, </i>It was his final salute 
        on earth to the one he considered as the "Mother of the Mission". </p>
      <p><b>Pope John Paul II reflects on Saint Eugene de Mazenod</b> <b>Canonization 
        Celebration - December 3, 1995 - Rome, Italy </b> </p>
      <p align="justify">"We are living in the second Advent of the world&#146;s 
        history. Eugene de Mazenod was a man of Advent, a man of the Coming. He 
        not only looked forward to that Coming, he dedicated his whole life to 
        preparing for it, one of those apostles who prepared the modern age, our 
        age. </p>
      <p align="justify">Eugene de Mazenod. knew that Christ wanted to unite the 
        whole human race to himself. This is why throughout his life he devoted 
        particular attention to the evangelization of the poor, wherever they 
        were found. </p>
      <p align="justify">By patiently working on himself, he learned to discipline 
        a difficult character and to govern with enlightened wisdom and steadfast 
        goodness.. His every action was inspired by a conviction he expressed 
        in these words: &#147;To love Church is to love Jesus Christ, and vice 
        versa&#148;. His influence is not limited to the age in which he lived. 
        but continues its effect on our time. </p>
      <p align="justify">His apostolate consisted in the transformation of the 
        world by the power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. What Saint Eugene wanted 
        to achieve was that, in Christ, each individual could become a fully complete 
        person, an authentic Christian, a credible saint </p>
