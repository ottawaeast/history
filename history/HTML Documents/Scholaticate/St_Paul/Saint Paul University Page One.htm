    <td>The following brief history of St. Paul was taken from the 2000 - 2002 
      University Calendar and used with the kind permission of the University. 
      <p>&quot;The origin of Saint Paul University dates back to September 26, 
        1848, when &quot;The <br>
        College of By town&quot; was founded by Bishop Joseph-Eugene Guigues, 
        O.M.I., who in <br>
        1856 officially entrusted the College to the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. 
      </p>
      <p>In 1861 the College of Bytown was renamed &quot;College of Ottawa&quot; 
        and on August 1866, <br>
        was granted university status by the Government of the Union of Canada. 
      </p>
      <p>By letters of Leo XIII, dated February 5, 1889, the College of Ottawa 
        was granted <br>
        the pontifical charter. </p>
      <p>To meet the requirements of Pius XI's Apostolic Constitution, Deus Scientiarum 
        Dominus, on the reorganization of Catholic universities, the administration 
        revised its pontifical charter which was subsequently approved by Rome 
        on November 15, 1934. The civil charter, which had been rewritten, was 
        approved on April 18, 1933 by the Ontario Provincial Legislature and he 
        University was henceforth officially known as 'Universite d'Ottawa&quot;. 
      </p>
      <p>In the years following World War 11, the University progressed rapidly 
        and by 1965, had <br>
        established nine faculties and four schools. </p>
      <p>The year 1965 marked the end of one era and the beginning of another. 
        On July 1st, through an Act of the Ontario Provincial Legislature and 
        after laborious negotiations between the University and the Provincial 
        Government, the institution heretofore designated as the University of 
        Ottawa became Saint Paul University, nonetheless keeping its civil and 
        canonical charters. At the same time the Provincial Government formed 
        a new institution to be known as the University of Ottawa to which Saint 
        Paul University conceded the majority of its holdings. The two Universities 
        became a federated complex and according to mutual agreement were to share 
        faculties. </p>
      <p>In addition to conferring its own degrees, Saint Paul University reserves 
        the right to present its candidates to the Senate of the University of 
        Ottawa for the joint conferment (Saint Paul University - University of 
        Ottawa) of its certificates, diplomas and civil degrees.</p>
      <p>Both Universities consider themselves complementary institutions. Saint 
        Paul University appoints eight members to the Board of Governors of the 
        University of Ottawa. The Rector of Saint Paul University is a member 
        of the Senate of the University of Ottawa, and the Faculties of Saint 
        Paul University are also represented in the academic Senate of the University 
        of Ottawa by their Dean, Secretary and a professor elected by his or her 
        colleagues. Moreover, the two Universities benefit from a mutual exchange 
        of professors and they mutually recognize their courses. </p>
      <p>The North Pavilion of the University houses the central administration, 
        the Faculty <br>
        of Theology, the Faculty of Canon Law, the Faculty of Human Sciences and 
        the Research Services of Saint Paul University. It also includes a library 
        and a mediatheque, <br>
        two auditoriums, lecture, workshop and seminar rooms, offices for professors 
        and <br>
        administrators and lounges for students, professors and support staff. 
      </p>
      <p>The Centre for Ministry Formation (including the University Seminary) 
        and Novalis, <br>
        formerly the Catholic Centre, are an integral part of Saint Paul University, 
        the first <br>
        one offering integral formation to candidates for lay and ordained ministries 
        and <br>
        the latter, located in the South pavilion, being a Christian educational 
        organization. </p>
      <p>The University publishes, among others, the following periodicals: Theoforum 
        (Faculty <br>
        of Theology), Studia canonica (Faculty of Canon Law). Mission (Institute 
        of Mission <br>
        Studies and Interreligious Dialogue), Living with Christ Prions en Eglise, 
        En El Nombre <br>
        Del Padre, Celebratel, Rassembler (Novalis). Grail (with the University 
        of St. Jerome's <br>
        College), Pastoral Sciences - Sciences pastorales (Institute of Pastoral 
        Studies). Logos (Sheptytsky Institute). </p>
      <p>Saint Paul University with strong traditions is fully aware of its special 
        mission and <br>
        possibilities. Its geographical location, its bilingual character, its 
        federation with the <br>
        University of Ottawa, its competent and diversified teaching staff, contribute 
        to the <br>
        quality of the academic training and the Christian culture which it endeavours 
        to <br>
        guarantee.&quot;</p>
