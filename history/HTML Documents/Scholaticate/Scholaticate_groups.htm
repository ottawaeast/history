    <td>The grouping shown in the figures from the 1891 and 1901 censuses continued 
      well into the Twentieth Century, although at a much reduced level. In the 
      1940's and 50's French Catholics dated, married and buried French Catholics. 
      The same was true for the English Catholics, Anglicans, Wesleyans and Lutherans. 
      The interaction with their respective churches was significant in that it 
      determined much of the social life of the community.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the Knights of Columbus would hold a large gala event to celebrate 
      confirmation of new church members. Imagine part of Main St. at Graham festooned 
      with garlands while fifty or so young boys and girls, dressed all in white, 
      marched to Canadian Martyrs Church. And then picture the Salvation Army 
      band standing on Mrs. Morrison's front lawn hill (off city property) at 
      the corner of Concord and Hawthorne, playing for two hours to the neighbourhood 
      - that same night! Every denomination had their own way of making their 
      presence known<br>
      <br>
      Far and away, the Oblates had the most significant role to play in the community. 
      They supplied the teachers and religious leaders, along with related Orders, 
      to the Ottawa East community. Amongst all of this was the Scholasticate 
      itself - a great whack of land right in the center of it all. But it could 
      not have been further removed in reality. As a religious community, most 
      of its concern was directed inward as can be seen in a <a href="Scholaticate_1930_Life.htm">1930's 
      snapshot of the life in the Scholasticate shown here</a>.<br>
