      <p><b>The Oblates and Ottawa </b> </p>
      <p>The first Oblate to arrive in Ottawa in June of 1844 was Fr. Adrien Telmon 
        from Montreal. By September of 1848 he, along with fellow Oblate Joseph 
        Eugene Bruno Guigues (the first Bishop of Ottawa) had established St. 
        Joseph&#146;s College. This was a small wooden structure located near 
        the site of the present-day Notre Dame Cathedral. Initial enrolment was 
        comprised of 60 French and English speaking young men <b><font size="1">(3)</font></b>. 
        Civilly incorporated in 1849, the College of Bytown became the College 
        of Ottawa in 1861; and in 1866 received the rank of university. The first 
        Bachelor degree was granted in 1872 <b><font size="1">(4)</font></b>.

      <p><b>The Two Solitudes Emerge</b></p>
      <p>From the outset, the College of Ottawa (University in 1889 <b><font size="1">(5)</font></b>) 
        was intended to serve the needs of both English and French Catholics. 
        The driving force behind this philosophy came from Fr. Joseph-Henri Tabaret 
        (1828 &#150; 1886), &quot;a man of vision, courage and great common sense&quot; 
        <font size="1"><b>(6)</b></font>. To most, he is thought of as the true 
        founder of the university as he <img src="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/ssj_71.jpg" width="200" height="136" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="University of Ottawa - originally built and operated by the Oblates up to the 1960's">guided 
        the evolution of the institution through the formative years from 1853 
        to 1885. He was key in establishing that learning would occur in both 
        languages so as to &quot;lessen those grievous prejudices that separate 
        these two peoples who are so well calculated to have a high regard for 
        one another&quot; <b><font size="1">(7)</font></b>. This vision however 
        foretold of a coming separation between the University and the Oblate 
        Order that would result in the building of Ottawa East&#146;s two largest 
        institutions!</p>

      <p>The 1891 census manuscript for Ottawa East shows that there were 293 
        residents identified as being Roman Catholic. Using the 1871 and 1901 
        censuses to that lists heritage, it was possible to identify 111 as being 
        of Irish origin and approximately 172 as being of French-Canadian origin. 
        There were a few others who listed Scottish or English origin. The ratio 
        for Ottawa East therefore is 1<b>.</b>55<b>:</b>1 for French to Irish 
        Catholics. </p>
      <p>A detailed analysis of the 1901 Census for Ottawa East can be <a href="../Databases/Ottawa%20East%201901%20Census%20Introduction/1901%20Census%20Page%20One.htm">found
