      <p><b>The Oblate Presence Today </b> </p>
      <p>As the 1930&#146;s progressed, St. Pat&#146;s continued to grow and school 
        activities became an integral part of the Ottawa East community. Across 
        Main St., &#145;Scholaticate&#146; demands on space and teachers were 
        also increasing. By the mid-1930&#146;s the number of seminarians from 
        various Canadian and American diocese had dramatically grown and space 
        was desperately short. By now the ecclesiastical Faculties at the University 
        of Ottawa had become a separate bloc of students who were priestly candidates 
        and studied a religious rather that secular curriculum in Latin. It was 
        decided therefore by the Senate to create a new seminary that would combine 
        the Faculties in the same premises as the future priests. In 1936 the 
        administration commenced building the new facilities on land near the 
        Scholasticate.</p>

      the Faculties of Theology and Canon Law moved into the building with the 
      Faculty of Philosophy coming later in 1943. In 1948, the Institute of Missiology

      opened the new Sedes Sapientiae Center. The building cost $1.5 million and 
      accommodated 50 student-priests, 18 professors, 13 classrooms, a 325-seat 
      lecture hall, cafeteria and a 100,000 volume library in a separate wing

      Canadian and foreign students, both men and women, from some 40 dioceses

      the point where it had become one of the principal institutions of higher 
      learning in Canada. With this came increasing demands for funding. Up to 
      that time the Oblates had the total responsibility for the cost of University 
      operations. Public funds, except in special circumstances, were not available 
      to any denominational school. As deficits grew, a solution was sought to 
      both preserve the Catholic nature of the institution while at the same time, 
      acquire the much-needed &quot;public&quot; classification.</td>

    <td colspan="2">The solution to this financial dilemma came in 1965 with the 
      creation of two new universities. St. Paul changed its title from a Seminary 
      to a University. The University of Ottawa became a public institution and 
      the sole responsibility of the Province of Ontario. The two universities 
      then formed a federation with the agreement that Faculties and Departments 
      would be shared. St. Paul became responsible for the Faculties of Theology 
      and Canon Law and associated institutes. All &#145;civil&#146; Faculties 
      and Schools were now under the jurisdiction of the University of Ottawa. 
      Only the Faculty of Philosophy remained both civil and canonical.</td>

      <p>St. Paul retained the Sedes Sapientiae and the Seminary on Main Street. 
        With over 700 students and new research and teaching divisions by 1969 
        it became clear that new space was needed. The situation was somewhat 
        attenuated when Oblate staff and student-priests moved out of the Sedes 
        Sapientiae thereby providing more space for classrooms and offices. Then, 
        in the autumn of 1981, a new addition was completed that was large enough 
        to house a much-expanded library, a 175-seat amphitheatre, 4 classrooms, 
        a media centre, offices and a work area.</p>
      <p>And St. Paul University continues to grow. By 2000, it had grown to include 
        a Christian community of some 1,100 professors, instructors, support staff 
        and students. In now houses: three Faculties (Theology, Philosophy and 
        Canon Law); three institutes (Mission Studies, Pastoral and Social Communications); 
        four journals; the Centre for Research in Canadian Religious History; 
        the Centre for Techno-ethics; a publishing house (Novalis); and a Seminary 
        for the formation of priests. A more complete story of the role St. Paul 
        University plays in the Ottawa and world community can be found <a href="St_Paul/Saint%20Paul%20University%20Page%20One.htm">here</a>.</p>
