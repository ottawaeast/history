      shown here is a representation of her in Brittany. 
      <p>In 1902, at the request of the Oblate Fathers, five Sisters were sent 
        to the Scholasticate to provide domestic service and that continued until 
        1969. A small convent was built just adjacent to the Scholasticate as 
        seen in the photograph below. This original convent was lost to fire in 
        1913 and was replaced by the present structure in 1915.</p>

      <p>By 1910 the Sisters had established their own convent at the present-day 
        site on Oblate Ave. to receive novitiates for their Order. In 1911 the 
        Sisters opened a boarding school that initially taught elementary <a href="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/X_77%20Sacre%20Coeur%201910.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/sm/X_77%20Sacre%20Coeur%201910%20sm.jpg" width="136" height="205" align="left" border="0" vspace="3" hspace="5" alt="Sacred Heart Convent - 1910"></a>levels

        200 students boarded at the school. The original name of the school was 
        the &quot;Pensionnat &agrave; Externat du Sacr&eacute;-Coeur&quot;. Outside 
        students came mainly from the Ottawa East area.</p>
      <p>The training of novitiates for the Order initially took 2 years and that 
        was later extended to three years. Many of the Sisters received teacher 
        training at the University of Ottawa and taught in many of the schools 
        throughout Ontario. The Sacred Heart Sisters taught at De Mazenod School 
        on Main St. from 1938 to 1969.</p>

    <td colspan="2">As the Sacred Heart Order grew, so did the building with wings 
      added to the original structure as the photographs of the convent below 
      demonstrate. Well into the 1940's the Sisters maintained a large <a href="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/X_81%20Sacre%20Coeur%20chicken%20coop%201954.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/sm/X_81%20Sacre%20Coeur%20chicken%20coop%201954%20sm.jpg" width="159" height="147" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="3" border="0" alt="Sacred Heart Chjicken Coop - 1954"></a>vegetable 
      garden on the northwest portion of the property near Main St. as well as 
      a chicken coop that supplied food for convent. At one point they even had 
      a milk cow that regularly escaped the fence to prowl Ottawa East. A major 
      renovation and extension of the building took place in 1954 with the addition 
      of the back wing and the chapel. In addition the Order has living quarters 
      for many Sisters in the houses on Main St. between Oblate and Springhurst 
      Avenues. 
      <p>By 1961 the Order had grown to a point where it regrouped forming two 
        &quot;religious provinces&quot;: the Province of Notre-Dame-du-Cap (Ontario) 
        headquartered on Oblate Avenue; and the Province of Notre-Dame-du-Sacr&eacute;-Coeur 
        in St. Hubert (Quebec). In that year there were 246 Sisters, 31 Novices, 
        25 students and 2 pensioners in the Ontario Province.</p>
      <p>By 1995 the convent ceased to train new novitiates. Many Sisters continue 
        work outside of the convent in <a href="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/X_79%20Sacre%20Coeur%20modern%20chapel.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/sm/X_79%20Sacre%20Coeur%20modern%20chapel%20sm.jpg" width="175" height="107" align="left" border="0" alt="Sacred Heart Convent - modern chapel" vspace="3" hspace="3"></a>teaching 
        and nursing positions. Today 95 Sisters live at the convent with many 
        of the aged cared for in second floor infirmary that is staffed with nurses 
        24 hours a day. In addition the Order continues to maintain many missions 
        throughout the world that are supported in part by the many crafts that 
        are produced by the Sisters.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>As with the Oblate Fathers, the Sisters of the Sacred Heart have played 
        a major role in the churches and schools of the Ottawa East and continue 
        to do so even today.</p>
