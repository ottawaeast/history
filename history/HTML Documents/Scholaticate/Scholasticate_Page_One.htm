    <td colspan="2">The historical importance to Ottawa East, of what is commonly 
      referred to as the &quot;Scholasticate&quot;, cannot be overstated. As part 
      of an expansion from France to Canada in the 1840&#146;s, the Oblates of 
      Mary Immaculate (OMI) established an organization that became instrumental<img src="../Image%20Library/Scholaticate/OMI/sm/SJ18_OblateShield.jpg" width="200" height="205" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5"> 
      in the creation of the Catholic churches and schools in Ottawa East; as 
      well as the University of Ottawa, St. Patrick&#146;s College and ultimately 
      St. Paul University. From the early 1860&#146;s, it was the Oblates who 
      provided the spiritual leaders and teachers for the large Ottawa East Catholic 
      community in both French and English. In doing so, the presence of this 
      group of priests played a defining role in the cultural evolution of the 
      community. And the influence continues even today in not only our local 
      churches but also world-wide through their pastoral missions and the internationally 
      recognized theological center of St. Paul University. </td>

      <p>The very beginning of the organization that was to have such a profound 
        effect on Ottawa East can be found in Aix-en-Provence, France with the 
        birth of Eugene de Mazenod in 1782. As the son of a wealthy aristocrat,

        early idyllic lifestyle ended with the French Revolution of 1789 when 
        his family was forced to flee to exile in Italy. During this period of 
        time the young Eugene experience a spiritual awakening which led him to 
        the priesthood. In 1816, as part of his apostolic mission he created the 
        Missionaries of Provence and gathered together &quot;a group of zealous 
        priests to work with him . . . to live together as brothers . . . (and) 
        to imitate the virtues and examples of (the) Saviour Jesus Christ&quot;<b> 
        <font size="1">(1)</font></b>. In 1826, Pope Leo XII approved the Congregation 
        of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate <b><font size="1">(2)</font></b>. 
        The motto of the new organization was &quot;He has sent me to evangelize
