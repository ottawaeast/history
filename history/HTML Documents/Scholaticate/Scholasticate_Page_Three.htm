      <p><b>Priest Training and the Scholaticate </b> </p>
      <p>The training of candidates for the priesthood was of paramount importance 
        to the Oblate superiors from the very beginning of the College. Originally 
        diocesan priesthood students were educated at a small seminary established 
        by Bishop Guigues in 1848 near the College. Courses were taught by professors 
        from the College and senior seminarians. In 1856 the responsibility from 
        this was take over by the Oblates. Students traditionally studied dogma 
        and moral theology. In 1868 the number of subjects increased to include 
        Scripture, canon law, church history and homiletics (art of preaching). 
        The program was extended even further in 1877.</p>

      <p>With the Oblate priesthood candidates now geographically separate from 
        the University of Ottawa, the past issues of Anglicization of the institution 
        once again appeared. Under the rectorship of Fr. James McGuckin (1889-1898) 
        many of the Oblates (including those from France) set about to transform 
        the University into an English-Language institution. The argument was 
        that for the University to survive, two Catholic schools were needed: 
        one in Quebec City for Francophones; and one in Ottawa for Anglophones. 
        This &quot;was stoutly opposed by the large majority of French-Canadian 
        Oblates&quot; <b><font size="1">(19)</font></b>.</p>

        Frances Fallon&quot; <b><font size="1">(20)</font></b> removed from the 
        office of Vice-Rector. But Fallon did not give up his battle with the 
        &quot;French Fact&quot; and continued his political fight against bilingual 
        education. In 1910, after being appointed Bishop of London Ontario, he

        institutions such as the Orange Lodge (a powerful Protestant force at 
        that time). </p>
      <p>The dispute was further inflamed by the Province in 1912 when it issued 
        the infamous &quot;Instruction 17&quot;. Later called Regulation 17, this 
        edict limited financial support for French-language instruction in all 
        schools to the early years of elementary school and as a distinct subject 
        (not the language of instruction) to be taught for a maximum of one hour 
        daily. French-Canadians viewed this regulation (until it was revoked in 
        1927) as &quot;unparalleled provincial tyranny abetted by Irish Catholics&quot;
