    <td>One of the pleasantest festivities of Dominion Day was a strawberry festival 
      in aid of the Church of the Holy Family in Ottawa East. It might more properly 
      be called a picnic for it was a continuous performance from 1 p.m. to 9 
      p.m. and many things besides strawberries were prepared for the pleasure 
      of those who attended. The scene of the picnic was a large and shady grove 
      forming part of the grounds of the Oblate Scholasticate on the banks of 
      the Rideau River. The frame work of the new church rising up a little to 
      the right of the Scholasticate was gaily decorated with flags, while the 
      grove itself was fairly bristling with flags both small and large. There 
      are a number of French Canadians in the Parish, so the tricolor was in evidence, 
      but the Union Jack was the prominent note of decoration having a good accessory 
      in the green flag with the Irish harp. Small tables were arranged under 
      the trees, at them ice-cream and strawberries were served - there was a 
      candy table - a soft drinks table, a large table where high tea was served 
      from five o'clock on, a fish pond, and a table upon which stood a handsome 
      four-storied wedding cake upon which chances were taken for 10 cents. The 
      tea table was always well patronized - if one person rose, another was ready 
      to take his place. It was decorated with potted plants and was in charge 
      of Mrs. Grovernor and Mrs. Meagher who, with their several willing assistants, 
      were kept very busy. 
      <p>The new parish of the Oblates in Ottawa East is a large one and judging 
        from the attendance the parish turned out well - though as the festival 
        has been announced in several churches of the city there were representatives 
        from other parishes. It being Dominion Day, the houses along the route 
        were gay with flags.</p>
      <p>For the convenience of those coming from the city, a bus met the Elgin 
        streetcar and carried passengers to and from the picnic grounds. Mr. Clarke, 
        the shoemaker of Ottawa East, was the guardian over the entrance and he 
        appeared to be well satisfied with the gate receipts. It seemed to be 
        in every way a most successful picnic - everyone was apparently making 
        money. The response to the question: &quot;How are you getting on?&quot; 
        was usually the playful shaking of a little bag in which the clink of 
        many coins was distinctly heard. Mr. Bernard Slattery was the president 
        of the picnic committee. Mr. J.J. O'Gara, the vice-president; Mr. O'Farrel 
        was the chairman of the sports committee, and Mr. St. Laurent was the 
        secretary. Mrs. Bernard Slattery was the English president of the ladies' 
        committee, Mrs. St. Laurent, the French president; Mrs. O'Gara, widow 
        of Magistrate O'Gara, being one of the most prominent residents of Ottawa 
        East, was among the ladies on the committee; she and Miss Kathleen O'Gara 
        had charge of one of the gardens where ices and strawberries were dispensed. 
        A good sign of the general prosperity was that although a large quantity 
        of ice-cream had been provided, it gave out and Mrs. Rogers was telephoned 
        to for more. The candy table was in charge of Mrs. Mainville and Mrs. 
        Danis, assisted by Miss SImard, Miss Justine, Miss Jennie Mainville and 
        Miss Dubreuil. The wedding cake was made by Mrs. Kiely, throws were taken 
        by Miss Kavanagh who sat behind the table on which stood this beautiful 
        and tempting confection of white frosting and silver ornamen-tation. </p>
      <p>The fishpond where the fishing was done with real rods and real hooks, 
        was in Miss Gertrude Slattery's charge, who had for assistants Miss E. 
        McClary, Miss E. McKeown and Miss McGuichien. The fishpond appeared to 
        be immensely attractive. There were races during the afternoon and various 
        prizes were won. The prizes were on exhibition in one of the parlors of 
        the Scholasticate. Then, there were games which delighted the small boys 
        who took part and the small boys who looked on but, of greatest interest 
        to the public in general, was the baby-show. Forty fat, rosy cheeked, 
        happy looking babies, under two years old, entered the competition, in 
        their mother's arms it might be added. The first prize was given to Mrs. 
        Arthur St. Laurent's baby and the second prize to Mrs. Donahue's baby. 
        The prize for the finest little girl, over 2 and under 4, went to Miss 
        Marjorie Slattery and the second to a little daughter of Mrs. F.-X. Desloges. 
        For boy babies, over 2 and under 4, the first prize was awarded to M. 
        Murphy and the second to John McVeigh. There was a competition in recitations 
        by little girls under 7. Miss Florence Slattery and Miss S. Flannigan 
        were tied in this. The first prize for French recitation went to Miss 
        Olive Dubois and the second to Florence Slattery. On the recitation competition 
        among girls under 10 years, Miss Irene Slattery won first prize and Miss 
        Rose O'Farrell second. Miss Z. Dubois won the first prize for French and 
        Miss Alice Grison the second. In the singing competition, Miss Rose O'Dowd 
        won first prize and Miss Katie Darcy second. In addition to these interesting 
        competitions<br>
        prepared for the enjoyment of the children, there was a young cart of 
        which Mr. Bernard Slattery Jr. was driver and in which a drive through 
        the grounds could be had for five cents. There were usually four happy-looking 
        children in the young cart.</p>
      <p>Rev. Father Charlebois, O.M.I., and Rev. Father Cornell, O.M.I., the 
        priests in charge of the parish, were both present at the picnic. Father 
        Sloan, of St. Mary's on Bayswater, was also there and Father Madden, O.M.I., 
        who leaves Ottawa for Vancouver to join Father McGucken.</p>
      <p>Mr. James Barrett's brass band was in attendance and provided a very 
        good programme of bright popular music.<br>
