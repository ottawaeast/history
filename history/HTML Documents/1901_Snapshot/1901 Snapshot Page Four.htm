      snippets have been found in various places but they are inadequate in terms 
      of an overview. However, thanks to the venerable James Ballantyne and his 
      daughter May, some revealing photographs are available that in many ways 
      chronicle village life at this time. With a little inductive thinking and 
      some speculation, a somewhat oblique view of this &quot;time period&quot; 
      can be had. 
      <p>As mentioned earlier the town hall was a focal point for activity. It 
        was the only &quot;public <a href="../Image%20Library/Buildings/PA133770.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Buildings/sm/PA133770sm.jpg" width="111" height="108" align="left" border="0" vspace="3" hspace="3" alt="Town Hall - no date - between 1899 to 1916"></a>building&quot; 
        that could be rented for social functions. The facility was used regularly 
        by the debating club, brass band and other interest groups such as the 
        Evangelicals. There is more on the town hall <a href="../History/Old%20Town%20Hall.htm">here</a>. 
        It appears that all the local dances were held in the town hall as well. 
        Trinity Anglican was too small for large meetings and it was only towards 
        the end of 1901 that the Catholics built a new school and church. The 
        public school buildings, on the edge of the largest swamp in the area, 
        were small, freezing in winter and oppressively hot in summer (not to 
        mention the black flies and mosquitoes). </p>

        opposing such nefarious activities as pool halls being located in barbershops. 
        Ottawa East was decidedly conservative to say the least! It is probable 
        that the nearest &quot;watering hole&quot; was located across the swing 
        bridge to Bank or Elgin Streets or up East Avenue (Echo) to the market. 
        And if you actually wanted water, it was as close as the backyard pump.</p>
      <p>A Post Office and grocery store was located on Main near East Ave., run 
        by Brigit Slattery. There were many other groceries listed in the directory 
        along with shoemakers, bakers, a druggist, dressmakers, butchers and barbers. 
        (John Messerschmidt started his barbershop on Second St. to later move 
        to Hawthorne at Main where it flourished as a family business well into 
        the 1960's.) Coal came from Ballantyne's, wood from Beaton's and there 
        was an icehouse on Wildwood. Almost everything an average family wanted 
        was within walking distance. What the family didn't grow in their backyard 
        was readily available from local gardeners.</p>

      numerous pictures of Mrs. Margaret Harvey's cows all over the damn place.

      dogs. Everybody had dogs. With no streetlights, a part-time constable, plenty 
      of foxes (preying on chickens), the odd bear and lots of rats, dogs were 
      an essential part of village life. The village constable received 10% of 
      the dog license fee so that law was strictly enforced. And there was no 
      garbage collection, road cleaning or &quot;stoop and scoop&quot;. What was 
      deposited on the roadways, stayed on the roadways until it decomposed. Coupled 
      with inadequate drainage (open ditches), backyard outhouses located near 
      the water pump, it was no wonder that council was constantly worried about 
      the outbreak of disease.</td>

      replete with boathouses and docks for a wide variety of personal watercraft. 
      Apart from the odd school or family trip to Britannia Bay, most of the village 
      children made there own entertainment. A favourite spot was Purdy's little 
      house on the tracks at Main St. Fortunately this was just across the street 
      from Ballantyne's house and there are numerous pictures of the local kids 
      just hanging out and having fun and always with a dog or two. In the winter 
      the canal of course became an outdoor skating rink and, unlike today, kids 
      were actually allowed to play hockey there!

    <td colspan="2"><b>A Final Note: </b> 
      <p>For the most part Ottawa East in 1901 was a working community. Life was 
        hard, every penny counted and there were few social amenities available 
        to all. The community was certainly not poor as most had the basics of 
        life - food, shelter, safety and relatively clean drinking water, but 
        any extras came only with their own initiative. And that trait was in 
        ample supply with these people. They built everything themselves, from 
        a water system and roads, to churches and schools. They made use of the 
        river and canal for transportation and recreation. And everybody knew 
        everybody else. The people were, de facto, a cohesive community that together, 
        resisted being subsumed by the city and steadily developed their own amenities 
        as the century progressed. The end of the municipality came in 1907 with 
        annexation, but the spirit of community persisted. In the next twenty 
        years the community would see the building of churches, schools and businesses 
        that would further consolidate this feeling of separateness. That spirit 
        continues even today. <br>
