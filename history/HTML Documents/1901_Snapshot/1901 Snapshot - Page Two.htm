      <p>The centre of the village was of course the town hall that had been built 
        under the direction of James Ballantyne in 1895. He lived across the street 
        at 54 Main in a large <a href="../Image%20Library/Buildings/PA134251.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/Buildings/sm/PA134251sm.jpg" width="182" height="143" align="right" alt="Two Maples - 54 Main - J. Ballantyne Home" border="0"></a>home 
        called &quot;Two Maples&quot;. His back garden (Ballantyne Park) connected 
        with his coal business located on East Ave. (Echo) overlooking the canal. 
        Across Main St., beside the town hall was the general store and office 
        of the Stewarton Lumber Company; both operated by George Barrett. Around 
        the corner and down the lane was the Wildwood Mansion, the home of the 
        late Robert Lees, one of the founders of the village. On the corner of 
        Main and Seventh (Hawthorne) was the home of Martin O'Gara, a high profile 
        magistrate and leader in the Catholic community. </p>

      <p>The village council had tried for years to force Booth to build a proper 
        crossing at the end of William St (Lees) so as to allow unhindered travel 
        to the north-eastern part of the village (Robinson Ave.). As one of the 
        richest men in Canada, Booth was a formidable adversary. As the story 
        goes, he built the Ottawa East rail line next the Lees property to destroy 
        the quiet and isolation of Wildwood. Whatever his reason, after he built 
        the line in 1882, he and Robert Lees battled ever after.</p>

      the village existed. About 20% of the employed adult males in the village 
      worked for the railways, in particular the Canada Atlantic. Most of the 
      village industry was completely dependent on rail transport as it brought 
      the coal and vast quantities of raw and finished wood and shipped out the 
      bricks. Further isolating Robinson Ave. was the vast array of lumber and 
      coals sheds and stack of wood along the tracks. The only commercial activity 
      in the area other than this was the slaughterhouse at the end of the street 
      on the bank of the Rideau River. The river was the key here. Think of all 
      the entrails that daily emanates from an abattoir and then wonder where

        This was huge circular building in the center of which was a turntable

        triangle formed between the rail complex and the canal was diverse. Amidst

        residences of some of the oldest residents of the village. For the most 
        part these were the descendants of the &quot;squatters&quot; who had fought 
        the Dominion Government for decades over the right to own the property. 
        Large businesses such as Ballantyne Coal maintained sheds next to the 
        rail line. There were even a hotels: The Atlantic, owned and operated 
        by Joseph Landriau; and The Beaver, owned and operated by Isaac Biggars. 
        Both were on the south side of East Avenue near Centre St. (Concord). 
        These establishment served the farmers and businessmen travelling along 
        the canal to the market in Ottawa. Blurry photographic evidence suggests
