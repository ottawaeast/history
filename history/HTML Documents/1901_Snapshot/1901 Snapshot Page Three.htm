        Census</a> lists a population of just over 1,400 people. The ethnic composition, 
        as shown by the graphs below, was made up from five main groups: French 
        (Quebec), English, Irish, German and Scots. About 16% of adult residents 
        were first-generation Canadians, employed mostly in blue-collar work. 
        English and French were spoken along with some German. The Irish and French-Catholic 
        families were the largest denomination. The rapid growth of this group 
        in the previous decade resulted in the creation of a new parish, church 
        and school between 1900 and 1902.</p>
      <p>At the other end of the data was Sam Wing. He was Chinese, Confucian 
        and the operator of the laundry at 22 Main (near Echo Dr.). He was also 
        the only person in the entire 1901 Municipal Directory listed with his 
        first name first. It appears that the directory editor wasn't familiar 
        with Wong as a last name. There was one black woman (Biggar's wife?) and 
        a Mohawk (C. H. Whitcomb) listed. Everyone else was from north European 
        ancestry.</p>

      <p>Council was under the direction of the Reeve Henry Roche, a gas inspector 
        for the government residing at<a href="../Image%20Library/People/PA134210.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/People/sm/PA134210sm.jpg" width="200" height="149" align="right" vspace="3" hspace="3" border="0" alt="Henry Roche fishing - Rideau River - hey it was the only picture I had of him !"></a> 
        39 Centre St.. The venerable Walter S. Barry, owner of an upholstery business, 
        living at 14 Seventh St., administered municipal affairs. Roche had narrowly 
        defeated Ira Bower, the local dentist and son of J. C. Bower, one of the 
        more powerful village residents. James Ballantyne had been nominated for 
        Reeve but resigned the nomination before the vote.</p>
      <p>There were four councillors elected as usual. James T. Harvey of 166 
        East Ave., a tinner, received the most votes. Wilfred Joly, a blacksmith 
        at 97 Main; William C. Ogilvy, a carpenter with the CAR living at 17 Second 
        St.; and Robert Biggar Junior, involved in the flour business, living 
        at 8 Fourth St. were the other councillors. All of council came from the 
        northern part of the village. This situation would eventually result in 
        the splitting of the village into two wards so that the southern part 
        had an opportunity for representation.</p>
      <p>Over the years three groups emerged vying for political power. The Catholics, 
        led by Slattery, Hughes, O'Gara, St. Laurent, Doran and others were lobbying 
        heavily at this point for a new, separate school funded by Catholic Ratepayers. 
        The English/Scot cartel of Lees, Ballantyne, Graham and Patterson families 
        still controlled the key expenses such as education, public works and 
        debentures through their alliance and nomination of like-minded councilors. 
        With this control the village refused to divvy up the taxes and support 
        another school. It must be remembered that Lees and Ballantyne had organized 
        and operated the first public school on a sparse budget. Given their ownership 
        of large businesses and major acreage in the village, they wanted taxes 
        kept to a minimum.</p>
      <p>The Catholic response was to create the Ottawa East Roman Catholic School 
        Board during the year and then officially notify council that, under the 
        law, the village was required to collect a separate school tax. They even 
        went so far as to approach J. R. Booth with a request to designate a portion 
        of his business tax for the GTR to a separate school. There is <a href="../Schools/Holy%20Family_Canadian%20Martyrs.htm">more 
        on this interesting story here</a>.</p>
      <p>The Germans had little success at achieving significant political power. 
        Although few were elected to council each year names such Romhild, Lemke 
        and Winges were involved in the nomination process. This group however 
        did receive a large portion of the village contracts whether for road 
        maintenance or village constable. There is more on the <a href="../History/Germans/Ottawa_East_Germans.htm">German 
        presence in Ottawa East here</a>.</p>
      <p>Apart from the political infighting, the major concern involved public 
        works. At this point in time the village<a href="../Image%20Library/General/PA131969.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/General/sm/PA131969sm.jpg" width="200" height="147" align="right" border="0" alt="A wooden sidewalk - two dudes - and a dog!" vspace="3" hspace="3"></a> 
        lacked a proper water system and adequate drainage. There was a constant 
        fear of epidemics breaking out due to ground water contamination. Simple 
        amenities such as snow clearing from the few wood plank sidewalks were 
        hard to come by. And street lighting became a major issue. The ratepayers 
        were now demanding safety and basic urban amenities.</p>
