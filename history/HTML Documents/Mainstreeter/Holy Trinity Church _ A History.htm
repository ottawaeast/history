      When some families went to church in Ottawa East in 1877 they had to row, 
      or be rowed across the canal and, back again when the service was over. 
      The little red brick building at Echo Dr. and Main Street, once known as 
      Holy Trinity Anglican -Church of Archvi11e (now Ottawa East) is still standing 
      and now the property of the Portuguese Community Centre of Ottawa Car1eton.Still 
      a well-known landmark, the site of the church was obtained from the late 
      Archiba1d Stewart, after whom the village of Archvi11e was named. The church 
      was opened for Divine Services the first Sunday in September 1877.Costs 
      of the church were as follows: land $875.00; building $2,313.88; fence and 
      porch $108.21, basement $200.43, and furniture $465.99.<br>
      <br>
      Years after he served at Holy Trinity, the late Robert Jefferson, Reverend 
      and former Anglican Bishop of Ottawa, co-authored a pamphlet called, &quot;Faith 
      of our Fathers - the Story of the Anglican Diocese of Ottawa&quot;. The 
      pamphlet reads in part: &quot;few of the congregations in the Diocese of 
      Ottawa have a rowboat as part of their church property, but when Holy Trinity 
      Church on Canal Road in the village of Archvil1e was built in 1877, a boat 
      was provided to ferry parishioners across the Rideau Canal, there being 
      no nearby bridge. 
      <p><b>Salary $200 a Year<br>
        </b><br>
        Continuing in the pamphlet, the authors recalled that lithe first rector 
        of Holy Trinity was Rev. T.O. Phil-ips and parish records show his salary 
        in 1880 to have been $200.00 a year. In addition to serving as rector, 
        Rev. Phillips was a high school teacher, a private tutor and a noted cricketeer.&quot;</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Holy Trinity was originally a mission attached to St. John's Church (now 
        Church of St. John the Evange11st, Elgin and Somerset Streets, Ottawa, 
        then located on McKenzie Avenue, opposite Majors Hill Park.) Later it 
        was attached to St. Barnabas Church, becom-ing an independent parish<br>
        in the early 1900's.</p>
      <p>Average collections in 1880 varied from $7.00 to $8.00 per Sunday. Records 
        indicate formation of a Ladies' Guild 1n 1884; a Woman1s Auxiliary in 
        1894, and a Sewing Society formed in 1902 to &quot;help reduce the church 
        debt&quot;. This society it is recalled, &quot;served faithfully for many 
        years &quot;.</p>
      <p>Mr. T.E. Gunderson of 30 Eleanor Drive, Nepean, in an article written 
        for the centennial of the Church of the Ascension, wrote: &quot;I attended 
        Sunday School each Sunday afternoon from the time 1 was ten at Holy Trin-ity; 
        that was a long time ago.&quot; He is now 88 years of age and has many 
        memories of his life in Ottawa East.</p>
      <p><b>Eyes Closed for Sermons</b><br>
        <br>
        Mr. Gunderson recalls that the rector was F.W. Squires (rector in 1896-1915 
        approx.) and I recall at many church services with my father, he preached 
        most of his sermons and rituals with his eyes closed. I shall always remember 
        that oddity.</p>
      <p>Today he explains that &quot;this oddity was probably caused by smoke 
        from wood fires in the church stove. The wood was often times green, and 
        I know my eyes used to get sore and red. Perhaps it<br>
        was the same thing with Mr. Squires, and with most of the congregation 
        as well. <br>
      </p>
      <p>He notes that &quot;there was no furnace in the basement, but a long, 
        pot-bellied stove inside the front door prov-ided the heat. A straight, 
        black smoke pipe went half-way up, then across and a-cross again near 
        the chancel all pipes being fastened securely with wire. The wood was 
        in four and six<br>
        foot lengths. This was the only heating equipment and as I recall many 
        times, the wood being wet caused dense smoke, and we choked, coughed and 
        had red eyes and sat in smelly clothes.&quot;</p>
      <p><br>
        In his pamphlet, Bishop Jefferson wrote further: lilt is an ill wind that 
        blows nobody good and when in 1904 the church was in need of a bell, it 
        happened that an engine of the Canada Atlantic Railway toppled into the 
        Rideau Canal. The bell from the salvaged engine was placed in the steeple 
        of the church and called the faithful to church for years until replaced 
        by chimes: The bell is now used in St. Augustine's Church, Newington, 
        Ontario.</p>
      <p>Bishop Jefferson was ap-pointed rector in 1916, and under his leadership 
        the parish grew so remarkably that a new and larger church was needed. 
        The new site on Echo Drive was pur-chased and the church became the Church 
        of the Ascension. The first sod was turned for the new church<br>
        in June 1919 by Rev. A. A. McKay and the cornerstone was laid by the late 
        Bishop Roper in September 1919. This church still serves Anglicans in 
        the district.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese Community Association purchased Holy Trinity in 1977 whereupon 
        it<br>
        became a centre for both members and non-members alike. Recently, the 
        church was apparently sold to a developer, but according to a community 
        spokesperson the deal has been held up<br>
        by a court action. At stake appears to be not only the future of this 
        historical property but also the way in which the Community Association 
        is to be operated.<br>
