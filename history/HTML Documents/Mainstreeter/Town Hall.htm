      In December 1888, after much petitioning the Carleton County Council by 
      local residents, the Village of Archville was officially incorporated as 
      Ottawa East. Residents argued that Archville was a separate and isolated 
      corner of the huge Township of Nepean which then stretched from Bell's Corners 
      to Hurdman's Bridge. The population of Archville had reached 800 residents, 
      and with incorporation, the $600 then paid in taxes to the Township could 
      be better used to improve local sidewalks, drains, streets and provide fire 
      protection. 
      <p>One of the first tasks of the new Ottawa East Council, headed by Reeve 
        James Ballantyne local coal merchant and amateur photographer, was to 
        build its own Town Hall. Council purchased land from the Robert Lee's 
        estate at the corner of Main Street and Hawthorne Avenue and contracted 
        student architect Henry F. Ballantyne, son of Thomas Ballantyne and nephew 
        to James to design the building.</p>
      <p>The first official Council meeting took place in the new premises on 
        October 2, 1895 with Reeve Ballantyne presiding.</p>
      <p>According to the Ottawa Evening Journal:<br>
        &quot;No business of any importance was transacted, the attention of the 
        council being chiefly engaged on the settling of small accounts. The question 
        of furnishing the new building which includes the fitting up the public 
        hall on the second flat with a platform and curtain, etc. and a supply 
        of the secretary, council and committee. rooms with their proper fittings 
        was brought up and it was decided to do so as soon as possible. It was 
        also decided to have a crossing built from the new town hall to the sidewalk 
        on the opposite side of the road and to have a new drain laid. &quot;</p>
      <p>The Hall was formally opened on December 2, 1895 by an &quot;At Home&quot; 
        with speeches, songs, recitations and musical selections reported at great 
        length in the Evening Journal.</p>
      <p align="left">Since its inauguration, the Town Hall has been a key component 
        in the life and times of Ottawa East, housing everything from the Police 
        Commission to the Well Baby Clinic. Immediately after its opening, the 
        Hall was available for all kinds of soirees at the following rates:<br>
        <br>
        Dancing and Smoking Concerts $7.00<br>
        Other Concerts $2.00<br>
        Churches &amp; charitable purposes $1.50</p>
      <p>In July 1899, the Ottawa East Brass Band was granted an application for 
        the use of a room every Thursday for the purposes of practicing at a cost 
        of $<font size="4">.</font>35 per night - a practice that continued on 
        into the 1990' s for those of you who happened to be at the Main Street 
        Community Centre on Thursday nights. The Ottawa East Water Company, organized 
        by James Ballantyne, Ira Bower, Ber-nard Slattery, Charles Francis Winter 
        and William Andrew Dickenson Lees, was granted use of room in the south 
        corner of the Hall for the year 1904 provided that the Town Hall property 
        be exempted from water rates.</p>
      <p>In 1907, the Village of Ottawa East was annexed by the City of Ottawa 
        so that its official function as a Town Hall was over. The Baptist Mission 
        used the hall in 1908 and later that year so did the Ottawa Police Commission 
        and the Pub-lic School Board to house a kindergar-ten class room.</p>
      <p>From 1921 to 1923, the Town Hall was leased to the Separate School Board 
        to ease the space situation for French lan-guage students of the community. 
        The Separate School Board had been stalled in their search for additional 
        classrooms as a result of the infamous Regulation XVII which limited the 
        extent of French language instruction in provincial schools.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In 1925, Ottawa City Council briefly re-named the Old Town Hall, the 
        &quot;Rosedale Community Hall&quot; at the request of the Ottawa East 
        Municipal Association who had proposed that the community of Ottawa East, 
        in its entirety, be named Rosedale. The concept of &quot;Rosedale&quot; 
        only lasted a short while, however, and by 1933, it was back to the &quot;Ottawa 
        East Town Hall&quot;.</p>
      <p>The building housed the Ottawa East Well Baby Clinic in the early 1950's 
        and continued to serve the community as a recreation centre for the next 
        30 years. In 1982, City Council designated the Old Town Hall a heritage 
        building and in 1986 ap-proved a budget for its renovation which was completed 
        and officially re-opened in September, 1988.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In December 1988, the residents of Ottawa East held another &quot;At 
        Home&quot; at the Town Hall to celebrate 100 years of the incorporation 
        of Ottawa East. Watch for the next &quot;At Home&quot; this summer to 
        pay homage to a grand old building and a symbol of Ottawa East.<br>
