      <p>Thirty-eight years ago on February 8th, the Royal Canadian Air Force 
        Flyers Hockey Team (RCAF Flyers) representing Canada in the Olympic Winter 
        Games in St. Moritz, Switzerland, won<br>
        the final game 3-0 against the Swiss National Team, thereby redeeming 
        Canada's lost glory after the 1936 Games in Germany.</p>
      <p>After the cessation of hostilities in 1945, a touring hockey team of 
        air-force personnel based in England travelled to sever-al European countries 
        for a series of exhibition games. Doctor &quot;Sandy&quot; Watson, now 
        our leading opthamologist, was the manager and when transferred to Ottawa 
        the following year, had 'visions' of taking an all-airforce team to com-pete 
        in the 1948 Games.</p>
      <p>Watson had a willing ally in the Air Commodore, Dave MacKell, an athlete 
        of note in his earlier career. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal 
        W.A. Curtis and the Minister of National De-fense Mr. Brooke Claxton were 
        also hockey fans and listened attentively to the effervescent Sandy Watson 
        who described the glory and prestige such an enterprise would bring to 
        the RCAF.</p>
      <p>Signals went out to all air force units in Canada and over 90 hopefuls 
        converged on Ottawa. Workouts were held at the local Auditor-ium where 
        ice was donated<br>
        by a generous Tommy Gorman. George Boucher of NHL fame would select the 
        team which then would be coached by his son, Frank, in Europe.<br>
        <br>
        A month prior to departing for the Games, it was found that the team was 
        not of sufficient strength to guarantee victory and other players were 
        added, many of whom were ex-servicemen.</p>
      <p>Five were supplied by a local senior team named<br>
        Burghs; Andre Laperriere came from Montreal Univer-sity, while three outstand-ing 
        and professional cali-bre players arrived fromToronto: Wally Halder, George 
        Mara and Murray Dowey. At the '48 Olympics, the RCAF Flyers were un-defeated 
        in the eight games played, scoring 69 goals and allowing only five, while 
        getting 5 shut-outs. </p>
      <p>The team was universally popular and completed all of its engagements 
        as well as agreeing to play several exhibition games in addit-ion to those 
        already scheduled.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Above all, the club had a distinct Ottawa flavour as eleven were from 
        this area: Red Gravelle, Ted Hibberd, Ab Renaud, Reg Schroeter, George 
        McFaul, Pete Leichnitz, Frank Dunster, Louis LeCompte, Irv Taylor, Patsy 
        Guzzo, Coach Frank Boucher and Manager Sandy Watson.<br>
