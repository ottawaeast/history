      <p>The Village of Ottawa East officially came into being as a result of 
        County Council motion #27, read a second and third time, on Friday morning, 
        December 7, 1888. With this legislation the tiny community of Archville 
        with a population of less than 1,000 people became a village within the 
        boundaries of Nepean Township. </p>
      <p>Sadly the early village records from 1889 to mid-1898 have been lost 
        to time but it is possible to extrapolate some information from scant 
        newspaper coverage and other sources. It is clear that the initial efforts 
        in forming a village administration were led by notables such as the Ballantynes, 
        Lees, George Patterson and others. Given the small tax base and the limited 
        powers within the Township of Nepean, it must have been a formidable task 
        to inaugurate everything from new bylaws to public works. And it must 
        be remembered that while the majority of ratepayers had fought against 
        annexation with the city in 1888, they did want certain amenities but 
        not higher taxes. These constraints must have led to some interesting 
        debates at early council meetings!</p>
      <p><b>Not A Police Village?</b></p>
      <p>Ottawa East Village is often mistakenly referred to as a &quot;Police 
        Village&quot;. In reality Ottawa East became a fully incorporated entity 
        with powers exceeding that classification. The process of becoming a Police 
        Village involved petitioning the county council for the special status. 
        Rayburn in his book &quot;Place Names of Ontario&quot; notes that in the 
        latter part of the Nineteenth Century this status was given to local communities 
        &quot;for the purpose of establishing fire and safety regulations in built-up 
        areas&quot;. The term &quot;police&quot; referred to the &quot;maintenance 
        of a place, as well as the preservation of good order, cleanliness and 
        related matters. Upon designation the village was allowed to elect 3 trustees, 
        improve its streets, erect street lights and perform other public functions&quot; 
        - all at the cost to village ratepayers. This designation conveniently 
        removed a burden on the township as a whole since it did not increase 
        the taxes of rural ratepayers who would not benefit from new village amenities. 
        Elliottt, in his book &quot;The City Beyond&quot; confirms this definition 
        and also notes that all actions of a &quot;Police Village&quot; were subject 
        to approval of the township&quot;. </p>
      <p>This was not the case for Ottawa East Village. There is no reference 
        in the minutes of seeking township approval or trustees. And it appears 
        that, from the very beginning, Ottawa East enjoyed near full autonomy 
        from Nepean Township as a fully incorporated village under the provincial 
        legislation. This allowed for the election (not appointment) of a Reeve 
        and council as well as many other powers.</p>
      <p><b>An Overview of the Village Circa 1890:</b></p>
      <p>A general description of the village in 1890 begins in the northeast 
        where Second St. (Greenfield) intersected with Hurdman Road, the only 
        route to the city. South, bordered by the Rideau Canal and the railroad 
        (Queensway) was the triangular-shaped Archville. This area was a mix of 
        civil servants, tradesman and the odd slaughterhouse. To the east was 
        an industrialized area with brick works and lumberyards in proximity to 
        the rail lines. To the west was the Canal Road with some light industry, 
        market gardens, hotels and some residences. English, Irish, Scots, French 
        Canadians and lots of Germans made up the main mix of the people. </p>
      <p>The concession road (Main St.) bisected this predominantly residential 
        area. Residents named the road after the process of packing stone invented 
        by a Scot named MacAdam - hence the universal term &quot;macadamization&quot;. 
        Rather than call it the &quot;Concession Road&quot; (of which there were 
        many in the region), they instead called it the &quot;Macadamized Road&quot; 
        (of which there were also many in the region). <br>
        Clever people those Ottawa Easters!</p>
      <p>There was some utility in this naming as revealed by a conversation between 
        a young Gustave Lemke, a recent German immigrant, and Robert Lees, the 
        venerable and decidedly Scottish village lawyer. Inquiring about an address, 
        Gustave asked in heavily accented English &quot;Ver is Macadam&quot;? 
        Lees replied in his finest burr, &quot;Aye laddie that'd be the one with 
        the stone&quot;.</p>
      <p>South of the old Archville, the housing density dropped significantly. 
        Much of the land was held by farmers and land speculators, and there were 
        few streets. The large tract of land owned by the Oblates not only housed 
        the Scholaticate but also a massive vegetable garden, butcher shop, maple 
        syrup cabin and a cemetery. A daily event in the village was the procession 
        of 30 or 40 student priests as they made their way, dressed in full frock 
        along the Macadamized Road to the Canal Road and then to the University 
        of Ottawa. Twice a day!</p>
      <p>At the southern tip of the village was Barney Slattery. Ontario born 
        and a prominent leader in the Irish community, along with his sons (no 
        daughters) William, John, Eddie, Barnard and Gladstone, he operated a 
        large farm that specialized in raising beef. On any market day there was 
        a distinct possibility of Slattery driving 50 head of cattle, festooned 
        with banners and bells, up the Macadamized Road through the village and 
        across a bridge which connected to Argyle St. What better way to advertise 
        your product!</p>
      <p>There was employment in the village working for the various local industries 
        but many worked in the city. Getting there was chore at the best of times. 
        With no local transportation, the main mode of commuting was on foot. 
        Imagine living on Clegg St. and slogging through knee-deep snow on a bitter 
        January morning up the Canal Rd. to the bridge over the canal. There were 
        no sidewalks; or snow removal in that area. In the spring it was mud and 
        in the summer - dust. It is no wonder that a major topic, at almost every 
        council, was sidewalks. </p>
      <p>The village employed many residents, mostly for labour with the odd official 
        position such as constable or assessor. Tenders for the most part were 
        given to locals who almost always had the lowest bid. Perhaps that was 
        the result of many bidders having spent time on council in previous years! 
        While the village had over 1,000 residents, most of the local work (and 
        politics) involved a small cadre of men who had their own personal agendas. 
      </p>
      <p>Just one example of a ratepayer who earned his living in the village 
        is that of Wilhelm Rhomhild. Arriving from Germany in 1888, he quickly 
        learned English and set about to make a living for his family. At any 
        one time, according to the village minutes, he painted the village fire 
        hall, fumigated houses for the Board of Health, broke stone with a hammer 
        for $2.25 per ton, erected street signs and buried dead animals. His most 
        infamous position was that of the Village Constable. A physically powerful 
        man he had the duty of enforcing council bylaws including the dog tax, 
        for which he received 10% of the money collected. And this was a significant 
        part of his salary given that almost everyone had a dog to catch rats 
        and protect property. There were no early morning warm plastic bags in 
        Ballantyne Park - dogs worked for a living!</p>
      <p>There is much more on the personalities and activities in the village 
        during this time on the upcoming History Project CD-ROM that will be published 
        late this year. This overview is intended only to put the following topics 
        in a context. The synopsis below represents the life of the village from 
        about 1890 to the early part of the Twentieth Century as seen through 
        the eyes of the village council. It reveals a burgeoning, diverse community 
        where hard work, thrift and the future were the mainstays of village life. 
      </p>
      <p><b>The Village Council:</b></p>
      <p>From 1898 to 1907 the minutes list a council comprised of a Reeve and 
        4 Councilors. Nominations were held each year in late December with names 
        being put forward by a nominator and seconder. The person had until the 
        day of the election to resign the nomination. Nominations for Public School 
        Trustees were also held at that time. Even though there was a Separate 
        School, there was never any public election. Perhaps these positions were 
        filled by appointment through the church.</p>
      <p>The election was held in the first week of the following January after 
        the voter's list had been posted in the village. It appears that the polls 
        were open from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. At the closure of voting the clerk 
        read out the results and declared the winners. The first meeting of council 
        usually took place a few days later in the town hall (completed in 1895).</p>
      <p>Examining 9 years of existing electoral records, it is clear that the 
        political power of the village was held by a small group of men who formed 
        various alliances at election time. For example, the election for 1899 
        had a total of 39 possible names for candidates, nominators and seconders. 
        Only 21 individuals were actually involved though (54% of the total possible). 
        Similarly, in 1904 there was a possibility of 54 names yet only 29 were 
        involved (again 54%). </p>
      <p>And of course, there were no women ever involved in the politics of the 
        village. In fact the only few references to women in all of the recorded 
        years involved a few petitions from widows for drains; and women employed 
        to clean the town hall. </p>
      <p><b>Village Council Activities:</b></p>
      <p>Council met usually twice a month with special meetings held to discuss 
        major subjects such as school building or major drainage problems. Meetings 
        took place in the evenings as council members worked. There was no salary 
        or honourarium for council - only the clerk was paid. The usual order 
        of business was to first approve the accounts of the village. And every 
        single account, no matter how small, had to be recorded and approved by 
        a motion. Next on the agenda were the various letters sent and received 
        by council. By way of a motion or directive, the clerk would be authorized 
        to reply to the various communications received. Council also administered 
        policies via the mail directing the clerk to write to individuals or agencies 
        requesting compliance with council's wishes. </p>
      <p>By far the single most important topic discussed at council was that 
        of public works. Council regularly received &quot;petitions&quot; from 
        ratepayers requesting such things as drainage or sidewalks. Upon approval, 
        tenders would be requested for labour and/or materials. The lowest tender 
        was always accepted and work would commence under the direction of a committee 
        of councilors.</p>
      <p>About June each year council would hold a &quot;Court of Revision&quot; 
        with a jury where ratepayers could request a lowering of their tax assessment 
        or school support designation. Individuals in most cases were given some 
        relief but large organizations such as the railway or telephone company 
        never had their assessment reduced. For a small village the Canada Atlantic 
        Railway must have been a cash cow! After revision the mill rate would 
        be set for payments to the county, schools and village expenses including 
        bank debentures for building such things as the town hall.</p>
      <p><b>Appointments:</b></p>
      <p>Council had the yearly duty of making several appointments to positions 
        necessary for the operation of the village. Early on each year two auditors 
        would be appointed (one by the Reeve) to review the previous years accounts. 
        In 1899 the fee for each auditor was $3.00/year; by 1906 it was $10.00. 
        <br>
        R. Robinson filled the position of Tax Assessor in 1899 and was paid $40 
        for the year to both assess and collect the taxes. By 1906 the annual 
        fee for just the Assessor was $75. In that year George Patterson was appointed 
        Tax Collector at $85/year with the requirement that he post of a bond 
        of $500 to guarantee the village would receive the money. An interesting 
        note regarding this position was the rather slipshod procedure for records. 
        Throughout the minutes there are numerous references to tax records not 
        handed in and council refusing to pay for services. For example, J. Bower 
        was finally paid $40 for his 1895 services as Tax Collector in February 
        of 1899.</p>
      <p>Council was also responsible for appointing the members of the Board 
        of Health for the village. Terms ranged from one to three years. There 
        was no salary but members did receive payment for special meetings or 
        duties. The Medical Health Officer was appointed after various local doctors 
        were solicited for their terms. </p>
      <p>An important appointment was that of Village Constable. In 1899 a bylaw 
        was passed appointing Charles Rhomhild to the position. No salary was 
        specified, only that he receive a &quot;reasonable rate&quot; for &quot;every 
        hour that he is actually employed&quot;. His duties not only included 
        keeping the peace of the village but he was also responsible for: collecting 
        dog taxes, impounding cattle and horses at large and burying dead animals. 
        He received a percentage of the dog tax and any fines levied in court. 
        In addition: he posted street signs, fumigated houses under the direction 
        of the MHO, inspected outhouses and insured backyards were kept clean. 
        All of this on a part-time basis! By 1903 the constable received $50/year 
        with the additional responsibility of Pound Keeper (essentially the dog 
        pound).</p>
      <p>The position that remained the most consistent was that of the clerk. 
        From 1898 to 1907, Walter N. Barry, an upholsterer living on Seventh St, 
        held the position. His duties as clerk included recording all council 
        matters, at every type of meeting, and dealing with all communications 
        under the direction of council. Some of his minor duties included: purchasing 
        all administrative materials (stamps, stationery, etc.); the registration 
        of all births, deaths and marriages in the village (20 cents each in 1899); 
        and lighting fires in the town hall prior to meetings (25 cents/fire). 
        In 1899 the clerk was paid $16.25 quarterly and by 1906 the salary was 
        $200 per year. He was also the secretary for the Board of Health for which 
        he was paid $5.00 per year.</p>
      <p>The last important position appointed by council was that of the Village 
        Treasurer. In 1899 Andrew G. Acres was appointed at an annual salary of 
        $50. He replaced Thomas Ballantyne who had resigned earlier in the year 
        even though council had asked him to reconsider. He remained as Treasurer, 
        at $50/year, until the village was annexed. </p>
      <p><b>Public Works:</b></p>
      <p>The majority of council's time was taken up by this topic and this involved 
        the maintenance of drainage, roads and sidewalks. To accomplish this, 
        the village employed residents as labourers and ordered copious quantities 
        of stone, wood and nails. There were no machines - everything was done 
        by hand, sometimes with the aid of a horse. Labour rates in 1898 were 
        $1.25/day for one man working 10 hours; and $2.00/day for a man and a 
        horse. Rubble stone cost $4.50/ton and had to be broken by hand at about 
        $2.25/ton. </p>
      <p>Roads in the village were mainly packed soil. Repairs consisted of filling 
        in the holes with broken stone and grading. Streets had ditches along 
        the sides that constantly plugged with silt leaving large linear ponds 
        of foul, stagnant water. Most people drained their property including 
        the barnyard into these ditches. Only the Macadamized Road (Main St.) 
        was maintained with a packed stone surface. In certain locations proper 
        culverts were installed with pipe and covered by &quot;gully grates&quot; 
        to permit crossing.</p>
      <p>Sidewalks were made of thick cedar planks laid down in specific lengths 
        on poles set on a bed of stone. Various tenders show that the planks had 
        to be 3 inches thick and 3 feet long (no mention of width). These planks 
        were nailed to 9-foot cedar poles that had a minimum diameter of 6 inches 
        at the smallest end. In 1898 poles cost 16 cents each and contractors 
        were paid 20 cents/section for installation. In 1903 the village offered 
        residents new &quot;granolithic&quot; (cement) sidewalks. The catch was 
        that the majority of ratepayers on each street had to agree as they paid 
        the cost per foot.</p>
      <p>Snow removal was a labour intensive job to say the least. By 1902 it 
        appears that snow had become a major item with council. It is doubtful 
        that all the roads were cleared as people would walk or drive their sleighs 
        over the packed snow. Labour was probably used to clean the existing sidewalks 
        and a few main roads. Some examples of cost included: Michael Redmond 
        paid $7.28 for 48.5 hours of snow cleaning at 15 cents/hour; and J. C. 
        Ogilvie who earned $11.13 for work with a horse (44.5 hours at 25 cents/hour). 
        By 1904 the village employed 21 men and boys in January. Men received 
        15 cents while boys were paid 8 cents per hour. The village even purchased 
        a horse-drawn snow plow that year.</p>
      <p>Permanent sewers did not exist until 1904. Up to that time residents 
        (and industries) drained their property into the roadside ditches. There 
        is some mention in the minutes of residents along the canal discharging 
        their wastewater directly into the waterway. As there was no village water 
        system, pit privies (outhouses) were de rigueur. Some industries such 
        as slaughterhouses dumped directly into the Rideau River.</p>
      <p>As the village grew the need for a proper sewage system became critical. 
        Finally in 1903 ratepayers agreed to a debenture that would fund a main 
        trunk sewer with individual property owners paying for their own connections. 
        There was no sewage treatment of course. The village followed the accepted 
        practice and piped the effluent directly into the Rideau River (at Springhurst). 
      </p>
      <p>The absence of a village water system until 1904 was a major concern 
        for council. With the use of pit privies and backyard wells, the threat 
        of groundwater contamination was always present. As well, the village 
        did not have a source of pressurized water to fight fires. There had been 
        some rumblings of a water system in 1898 but nothing came of it. Finally 
        in 1903, several residents, including such village stalwarts as Ballantyne, 
        Lees and Slattery, banded together to form the Ottawa East Water Co. Within 
        a year the company had installed electric pumps to draw groundwater (the 
        Rideau River was deemed too polluted) and installed a system of pipes 
        with fire hydrants. Annual rates for individual homes ranged from $5 to 
        $10 with an extra 50 cents if a cow was owned. </p>
      <p>The village had access to electric power in the late 1890's as evidenced 
        by the regular electrical bill paid for the town hall. But there was no 
        street lighting (not even gas). In January of 1903 council passed Bylaw 
        #79 which gave the exclusive right to supply electrical power to the village 
        to the Ottawa Electric Company. As part of the agreement, the company 
        installed a system of wires and street lamps on the main streets at key 
        intersections. From that point on there were constant demands on council 
        from the ratepayers to extend the lighting system.</p>
      <p><b>Council Motions and Bylaws:</b></p>
      <p>Appointments and debentures always required a bylaw and most dealt with 
        such mundane topics as drainage or street openings. Every year there was 
        an ongoing debate with the railways involving excess train whistling or 
        track crossings. Council reacted to such topics with stern motions and 
        letters to the offending parties. On a more colourful note, in 1903 council 
        decided to clean up the morals of the village and passed Bylaw #90 which 
        involved all sorts of nuisances and immoralities. With this new law it 
        became illegal for example: to wash private parts in public places; expose 
        wounds or deformities to obtain alms; or operate a pool hall. </p>
      <p>Life in the Village of Ottawa East during this time was very similar 
        to most of the suburbs surrounding the city. The ratepayers constantly 
        petitioned the council for improvements to the basic amenities of roads, 
        sewers and protection of their property. In the end it was the absence 
        of an adequate fire department that tipped the balance and prompted a 
        slim majority of villagers to vote for annexation with the city. But it 
        was the hard work of the village council from 1889 to 1907 that created 
        a community that was characterized by the City of Ottawa Annexation Committee 
        as being &quot;a very desirable acquisition&quot;. The final financial 
        statement of the village showed that the assets exceeded the liabilities. 
        The community lost its autonomy when it joined the city, but the spirit 
        persisted and exists even today!</p>
