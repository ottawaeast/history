      <p>Robert Lees was the patriarch of the Lees family who lived in a house 
        called Wildwood. It stood, at the end of a long lane, on Main Street, 
        where the Queensway is now. </p>
      <p>Born in Scotland in 1814, he came to Canada as a babe in arms. His father 
        Andrew Lees pioneered in Pakenham, Ontario. Robert Lees became first a 
        schoolteacher, then a lawyer and Queen's Counsel.<br>
      </p>
      <p>He courted and married Jessie Dickson of Pakenham, and during their courtship 
        their exchange of letters included both historic and personal events. 
        There is a description of the riots on &quot;Stony Monday&quot; in 1849 
        on Rideau Street at Sapper's Bridge. He wrote: &quot;Bytown is a fearful 
        place to live in just now... The idea of making you take up your abode 
        in such a place is horrible.&quot; He made a reputation in defending some 
        of the radicals against what he saw as persecution by the authorities. 
      </p>
      <p>One of the letters refers to a family disgrace involving Jessie's sister, 
        which drove her to ask Robert if he wished to be released from the obligation 
        of his engagement to marry. The letter detailing the disgrace is unfortunately 
        missing. Some of the letters they wrote are difficult to read because 
        they are written in two directions on the same page - paper was dear.</p>
      <p>In fact, Lees did stay in downtown Ottawa after his marriage to Jessie 
        in 1852, and they lived at first in the Matthews Hotel (later became the 
        Rideau Convent). With their growing family they lived in a building on 
        George Street also housing the law firm of Lees and Gemmell. Four of their 
        children were born in Ottawa: Ella in 1853, Victoria in 1856, Elizabeth 
        in 1857, and William in 1859. Victoria was a sickly infant and not expected 
        to live, so they did not name her but called her &quot;Sister&quot; for 
        several years. She chose her own name - Victoria, after the Queen.</p>
      <p>The crowded town, epidemics of disease and bad drains in the summer led 
        them to move in 1853 to the country, to the suburb of Ottawa East, Nepean 
        Township, just south of the Rideau Canal. When a friend asked why he wanted 
        to live &quot;in the wild woods&quot;, Lees took that as the name of his 
        house and estate. Daughter Jessie was born at Wildwood in 1864. The estate 
        included a tenanted farm stretching from Main Street to the Rideau River, 
        and orchards and kitchen gardens near the house. Will sometimes worked 
        on the farm when he was home from university and law school. The whole 
        family worked in the gardens hoeing, weeding and all the other chores 
        familiar to gardeners. In the fall it was harvesting, canning and taking 
        the surplus produce to Byward Market - as reported in a diary: &quot;We 
        took along the girl to hold the horse&quot;.</p>
      <p>They seemed to do most of the housework themselves as it was difficult 
        to keep a girl to work so far out in the country. Their problem with the 
        yardman was that he was so often &quot;off on the spree&quot;. Cleaning 
        out the garret was such a triumph that they marked the occasion with a 
        photograph. Photography was coming into its own as a hobby for amateurs 
        and the Lees family and their neighbours the Ballantynes were keen photo-cranks, 
        taking photos of their homes, neighbours, relatives and the local scenery.</p>
      <p>Robert Lees took his role as Patriarch seriously. His five children were 
        all accomplished in music, writing, drawing and other arts. They boated 
        on the Rideau River, played tennis, snowshoed, sometimes to downtown Ottawa 
        to do their Christmas shopping. They formed the Wildwood Opera Society 
        for their own amusement, and presented concerts in the parlour. Every 
        week for years whichever family members, visitors and neighbours, especially 
        May Ballantyne, would meet by the dining room fire for Elocution Class. 
        Members took turns reciting selections of poetry or prose, some written 
        by other members of the class. One member each week was delegated &quot;Critic&quot; 
        and wrote up commentary on the performances for the family newsletter 
        the &quot;Wildwood Echo&quot;, published fortnightly. As reported, &quot;one 
        of the younger members fled the room during a recitation of &quot;The 
        Nancy Bell&quot;, complete with lip-smacking. (It is a humorous poem about 
        cannibalism by W. S. Gilbert.)</p>
      <p>The &quot;Wildwood Echo&quot; was a collection of contributions by many 
        members of the Lees' circle. They took it in turn to serve as editor to 
        hand-write the pages and distribute them by mail around the province. 
        It contained poems; a romance novel serialised over several months, essays, 
        drawings, photographs and watercolours. May Ballantyne was a prize-winning 
        painter of flowers.</p>
      <p>Also in the &quot;Echo was &quot;Thistledown&quot;, a column on the doings 
        at Wildwood and Ottawa East. These doings included: fighting off fruit 
        thieves at Halloween, gypsies with a dancing bear in the neighbourhood, 
        a chimney fire in which Cousin Bob (Robert Dickson Brown of Ottawa) proved 
        a hero by climbing the roof and extinguishing the blaze, and listing the 
        many visitors from Perth, Pakenham, Brockville and other places. At the 
        time of some troubles with the Fenians William formed the Wildwood Rifle 
        Club and taught the womenfolk how to shoot, in case they need to defend 
        themselves. Once the Fenians tried to burn down their house.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth's diary from 1879 recounts her time in Toronto attending the 
        Normal School and contending with a crummy boarding house. The boarders 
        seemed to be fed mostly gruel, but on Thanksgiving, when they hoped for 
        something special, they were given &quot;some bits of fried beef&quot;. 
        One day on arriving home from school, she found they had all been evicted.</p>
      <p>By 1884 Ella was married to Sidney Preston and living in Toronto. Elizabeth 
        taught school in Ottawa East from 1880 to 1884. When she married Cousin 
        Bob they moved to the house he had built at the other end of Main Street, 
        corner of Riverdale. It was called &quot;The Pines&quot; and was on a 
        large property that included a factory that Robert Brown owned on the 
        Canal. </p>
      <p>The part of the farm nearest Main Street was developed for housing about 
        the time that Robert Lees died in 1893. The planned streets were called 
        after the Lees children. </p>
      <p>William attained his law degree about the same time. He married Lizzie 
        Turnbull and they built a house, named &quot;Plain Air&quot;, on William 
        Street where Lees Avenue is now. They later moved to Wetaskawin, Alberta, 
        where William became Judge Lees. </p>
      <p>Jessie studied violin in Germany and gave music lessons at Wildwood and 
        in Ottawa. She later moved to Erindale, Ontario.</p>
      <p>Victoria moved in with Elizabeth and her son Robert Lawrence Brown at 
        &quot;The Pines&quot; when Robert Brown died in 1895. She did not marry 
        but built a house on Riverdale Avenue for herself in 1927. She moved to 
        a bigger house on the same street when her sister Jessie came to live 
        with her. Victoria, who had been a sickly child, out-lived the others 
        and died in 1942. <br>
