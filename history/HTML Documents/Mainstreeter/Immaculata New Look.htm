      <p>The architectural firm of Ed Cuhaci, Ottawa East resident, is managing 
        the transformation of the Echo Drive Algonquin College Campus into the 
        new site of Immaculata High School scheduled to open in September 1994.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The existing Colonel By Campus consists of three buildings situated around 
        a landscaped courtyard. The most prominent building on the site is the 
        College Building (built In 1930) with its main entrance facing Echo Drive. 
        It was originally built for St. Patrick' s College. From 1973 to 1992 
        the building housed Algonquin College of Applied Arts and Technology.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The campus has undergone several alterations and additions over the years. 
        In 1965 two <br>
        new buildings were added to the campus: Building A - horticulture, located 
        east of the courtyard; and a library building, Building B, located south 
        of the courtyard. The existing<br>
        courtyard, landscaped with a variety of plant, shrubs, and trees, is currently 
        maintained by the horticulture department of Algonquin College. .<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the proposed site development, the new gymnasium complex is located 
        where the horticulture building and library building now stand. The campus 
        courtyard has been redesigned and divided into two components: a paved 
        area, referred to as the students' &quot;square,&quot; which will serve 
        as a meeting place for students; and a landscaped area where special emphasis 
        will be made to maintain the existing landscaping. This redesigned courtyard 
        will be one of the appealing features of the campus.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The new library, located above the cafeteria, can be viewed from the 
        proposed new walkways to the campus buildings. This library is an important 
        feature in the new design and will play a great role in creating a new 
        image for the &quot;Immaculata Campus. &quot; <br>
        <br>
        The new gymnasium complex is a self-contained structure. In the event 
        that it will be used for community and evening activities, it can be separated 
        from the existing campus. The community entrance is located at the courtyard 
        level. It is well lit with natural light creating a comfortable, inviting 
        entrance. Also at this courtyard level are glazed windows which provide 
        natural light to the gymnasium, as well as the foyer below. Total cost 
        of the project is $12,000,000.</p>
