      <p>Starting in May 1989, the Faculty of Theology will offer a new pro-gramme 
        in theological formation for the teachers in the Roman Catholic Schools 
        of Ontario.</p>
      <p>This Pilot programme in Religious Education is the result of a close 
        collaboration between the Ontario English Catholic Teachers Association 
        (OECTA), the Ottawa Roman Catholic School Board, the Carleton Roman Catholic 
        School Board and the Faculty of Theology.</p>
      <p>This 30-credit programme will offer the teachers the possibility of obtaining 
        the additional qualification in religious education according to the rules 
        set by the Ministry of Education and OECTA.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>At the same time, the Faculty of Theology welcomes this programme as 
        a new and additional opportunity to realize one of its basic educational 
        purposes which is to prepare adult Christians for the service of the Church 
        and society in the field of Catholic education.</p>
      <p><b>Two Dimensions</b></p>
      <p>The programme has, as its basic rationale the integration of two dimensions 
        of the adult learning process: experience and reflection. To meet the 
        particular needs of educators, the programme will develop dynamic relationships 
        between content and process, between theological formation and the contemporary 
        life of the Christian community.</p>
      <p>The programme is divided into three parts arid is presented thematically. 
        There are significant differences between the design, content and cur-riculum 
        of this programme and the Initiation to Theology programme. The pilot 
        programme aims to be progressive and incremental, to incorporate integration 
        components, and to be sensitive to the mission and task of the participants.</p>
      <p>In the realization of this new programme, the Faculty of Theology will 
        be assisted by an Advi-sory Committee chaired by professor John Vanden 
        Hengel. The Committee is composed of <br>
        representatives from OECTA and the partici-pating School Boards, and of 
        an expert in adult education. The Faculty of Theology will request the 
        Senate of Saint Paul University to create a Certificate of University 
        Studies in Catholic Religious Edu-cation. This certificate will be granted 
        to those who have successfully completed the 30-credit programme.<br>
