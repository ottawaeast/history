      At the corner of Beckwith and Main Streets stand a pair of stone gates. 
      They are so distinctive that all. who come into the area notice them. They 
      might be the entrance to some grand estate. Closer examination reveals two 
      brass plaques. One designates them as a war memorial and one as a heritage 
      structure. 
      <p><b>Brantwood Place -a new idea in town planning.</b></p>
      <p>In 1911, Robert Sibbitt planned Brantwood Place as a new concept in subdivisions. 
        The area spanning Clegg Street to Elliott Avenue, and from Main Street 
        to the Rideau River, was to be developed as an exclusive neighbourhood.</p>
      <p>&quot;The principal roadway - Beckwith Road - has the decorative feature 
        of massive gateways of architectural masonry and ornamental ironwork--lending 
        an air of exclusiveness and distinction to this high class home section,&quot; 
        extols the real estate pamphlet.</p>
      <p>The pillars were solidly built of fieldstone with cement trim in 1912. 
        An ornamental iron structure By the late 1940's the which originally spanned 
        the s ton e gat e s had gate posts was removed many years ago.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The area did not grow as quickly as the developer had anticipated, partly 
        due<br>
        to the distance from the centre of Ottawa, and partly due to the flooding 
        of the Rideau River in the spring. The area began to develop rapidly after 
        the Second World War.</p>
      <p>By the late 1940's the stone gates had deteriorated and were considered 
        a hazard by the City. When a work crew arrived to demolish them, they 
        were met with angry residents who loved the landmark. The gates stood 
        firm.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>A war memorial</b></p>
      <p>Ottawa East residents negotiated with the City. If the gates became a 
        war memorial, they would be maintained in perpetuity by the City. E.P.Nunn, 
        a long-time resident, organized the project to save the stone gates. He, 
        like other neighbours, felt it was a worthy landmark to be preserved.Art 
        Humphries is one of the World War II veterans who went from door to door 
        gathering donations for a memorial brass plaque in 1949. &quot;I was born 
        on Clegg Street and joined the armed<br>
        forces in 1939,&quot; he says. &quot;In 1945, I returned to Ottawa and 
        married Jean, who also served in the war. We moved into a new house on 
        Glengarry Road and have been there ever since,&quot; he says.</p>
      <p>On November 11, 1949, the stone gates were dedicated &quot;to the memory 
        of those who made the supreme sacrifice and to the honour and glory of 
        those men and women of this community who served in the armed forces, 
        1914-1918/1939-1945&quot; .</p>
      <p>Acting mayor Geldert addressed a crowd of some 500 Ottawa East residents, 
        alderman L.L. Coulter unveiled the plaque, and wreaths were laid in memory 
        of F .0. Peter Lochnan and F.O. W.H. Thompson (RCAF).</p>
      <p><b>Rededication</b></p>
      <p>By 1977, the gates had again deteriorated and the brass plaque had fallen 
        off. Repairs were again made, and the plaque replaced. A plaque in French 
        and a new bilingual heritage plaque were also installed.<br>
      </p>
      <p>On November 11, 1982, the gates were rededicated. Alderman Nancy Smith 
        officiated. Art Humphries unveiled the memorial plaques (both English 
        and French community members who had lost their lives in the two world 
        wars. Saint Paul University hosted a reception.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The stone gates at Beckwith and Main Streets are a distinctive Ottawa 
        East landmark--for their historical value and memorial significance. The 
        plaque reads, &quot;Praise can add nothing to their<br>
        gallant worth.&quot; It helps us to remember those ordinary people who 
        did extraordinary things in times of war. It also helps to emphasize the 
        value of times of peace.</p>
