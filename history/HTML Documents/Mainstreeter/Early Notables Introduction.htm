      <p>The geography of any community involves not only involves the physical 
        characteristics of the land but also the people. In this second part of 
        the History of Ottawa East three important families who contributed to 
        the evolution of the community are detailed.</p>
      <p>The very first family in the area was that of <a href="Lewis%20Williams.htm">Lewis 
        Williams</a> who established a farm near Main and Riverdale in 1818. Originally 
        from England via Wales, Williams and his descendents continuously occupied 
        the original homestead into the 1950's.</p>
      <p>As the area transformed from agricultural to industrial/residential functions, 
        Ottawa East attracted people who saw the potential of inexpensive and 
        undeveloped land in close proximity to the city. One of the first to arrive 
        during this time was<a href="Lees%20Family.htm"> Robert Lees</a> (Lees 
        Ave.). Born in Scotland in 1814, Lees eventually settled in Ottawa East 
        in the 1850's where he became a successful lawyer, developer and gentleman 
        farmer. His shrewd political savvy was critical in the establishment of 
        Ottawa East Village in 1888 and was a community leader for decades.</p>
      <p>Another Scottish family, <a href="Ballantynes%20in%20Ottawa%20East.htm">the 
        Ballantynes</a> (Ballantyne Park), arrived in the Ottawa area in the 1860's 
        to establish a barrel-making business. By the 1870's the business was 
        moved to Ottawa East and eventually converted to selling coal. The presence 
        of James and Thomas Ballantyne had a profound effect on the community 
        both as industrialists and leaders on the village council. </p>
      <p>Williams, Lees and the Ballantynes are notable because it was their effort 
        and vision that, along with many others, helped shape the community that 
        we know today!<br>
