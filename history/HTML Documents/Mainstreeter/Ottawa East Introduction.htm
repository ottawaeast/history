      Tucked east and west between a river and a canal; and bordered historically 
      by a railroad and warehouse complex on the north with market gardens on 
      the south, lies the original suburb of &quot;Old Ottawa East&quot;. Begun 
      originally as Archville and Spenceville and then Ottawa East Village (1888), 
      this community has, throughout its history, maintained existence through 
      a sense of place and spirit exists even today. 
      <p>There are many factors that have contributed to the evolution of Ottawa 
        East (OE) from a farming community to a Police Village and ultimately 
        an integral residential part of Ottawa. These factors range from the region's 
        transportation geography, predominance of the Catholic and Protestant 
        communities and of course, the proximity to Canada's capital. </p>
      <p>Water, land, rail and even air transportation routes have historically 
        been major factors in the shape and function of OE. Initially the Rideau 
        Canal not only served as a western boundary that isolated OE from the 
        city itself but also provided a major shipping route for goods such as 
        bricks produced in the community. In 1831 land adjacent to the canal provided 
        the first major road (and only road until 1864) that connected Bytown 
        to the southern communities. The northern boundary for decades was an 
        extensive railway complex of a 'round house', repair shops and rail lines 
        with most of the workers and service industries based in OE. This was 
        a mainstay of the local economy well into the 1950's. <br>
        OE even had a connection to air travel! The very first flight of an aircraft 
        in the Ottawa area involved Slattery's Field at the junction of Riverdale 
        and Main Streets, where the Hydro Substation is now located. In September 
        of 1911 a biplane performed for the Central Canada Exhibition at Lansdowne 
        Park and used Slattery's field as a runway. </p>
      <p>By far the largest landowners in the history of OE are the churches. 
        The original land purchased by the Oblates in 1863 was developed into 
        St. Joseph's Scholastique (now Desch&acirc;telets) and St. Paul University 
        (the community's largest employer and a world-class theological research 
        facility). <br>
        St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church originally acquired a major portion of 
        OE as a 'glebe' in 1837. The church created the suburb of Spenceville 
        in 1864 and it was not until well into the Twentieth Century that the 
        last of the land was sold.</p>
      <p>And finally OE has been a major supplier of everything to the city throughout 
        the past two centuries. From skilled labourers to government workers to 
        fresh produce, beef cattle and bricks, OE has been an integral part of 
        the region's evolution and prosperity. Now as a residential community 
        with some tertiary industry, the next decades will of course bring more 
        change. It will be interesting to see if the community maintains the connection 
        with the past!</p>
      <p><br>
        To record the rich history of this community and make it available to 
        all, the Old Ottawa East Community Association had created &quot;The History 
        Project&quot;. Comprised of volunteers, the task over the next several 
        months will be to gather all of the documents, photographs and personal 
        recollections that illuminate the past and the present. This material 
        will then be published initially in regular articles in the Mainstreeter; 
        and then in a much-expanded format, on CD-ROM. It will be available free 
        to all community association members as well as libraries and archives.</p>
      <p>The Evolution of Ottawa East<br>
        From the beginning to 1907</p>
      <p>The evolution of Ottawa East Village can be seen in two distinct phases. 
        The first begins around the time of construction of the Rideau Canal (1826-32) 
        and ends with the ultimate annexation of the Police Village of Ottawa 
        East by the City of Ottawa in 1907. From this point to present, the community 
        evolved from an agricultural/industrial base to the present day residential 
        use. </p>
      <p>Originally part of Nepean Township in Carleton County, By-law #348 passed 
        on 7 December 1888, defined the incorporated Police Village. This was 
        the area east of the Rideau Canal, west of the Rideau River, bounded on 
        the north by the city limit (now Mann Ave.) and the south by the line 
        between Lots I and K (approximately Elliot St.) of Concession C and D 
        (divided by Main St.).</p>
      <p>The original land survey of the early 1800's divided the Ottawa area 
        into 200 acre lots. Such notables as William Stewart, George Patterson, 
        John Hickey, John Mutchmor, Robert Lees and the Church of Scotland acquired 
        land in Ottawa East. St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church owned all of Lot 
        H which was bounded by Glebe and Fifth Avenues from Bronson Ave. to Main 
        St. This was known as a 'glebe' (land for use and benefit of the church). 
        Technically then, the Glebe was part of Ottawa East well into the Twentieth 
        Century! By the 1880's most of the Concession C Glebe land east of the 
        Canal had sold to land speculators. All of the land bordering 200 feet 
        along the canal was owned by the Crown and controlled by the Ordnance 
        Department (military).</p>
      <p>Up to that point there was very little residential settlement in the 
        area as most of the land was used for market gardening to supply the city. 
        The northern part was predominantly settled by workers for the railway 
        and building trades and was known as Archville (1873). Named after Archibald 
        Stewart, this suburb extended from the canal to Harvey St.. The Village 
        of Spenceville (1868) to the south extended from Hazel St. to Clegg St. 
        along the canal. It was named after Rev. Alexander Spence of St. Andrew's. 
      </p>
      <p>Well into the 1880's, the southern boundary of the city west of the canal 
        was the suburb of Stewarton located between Gladstone to Isabella and 
        was populated mainly by government workers and professional. The majority 
        of the community wanted increased services and pressure began to build 
        for annexation to Ottawa. City fathers wanted to increase the tax base 
        and felt that areas such as Archville, Rochesterville, Hintonburg and 
        Mount Sherwood should be included in annexation to provide for better 
        planning of transportation systems and industrial areas. Month after month 
        there was heated debate between those for and against annexation. In 1887 
        the city requested that the Province permit absorption of all the adjoining 
        suburbs. The residents of Archville reacted and counter-petitioned. Led 
        by such notables as Robert Lees, James Ballantyne and John Graham, political 
        pressure was exerted and the Province relented allowing the creation of 
        the Police Village of Ottawa East in 1888.</p>
      <p>Now separate, the leaders of the village of about 1000 residents set 
        about developing services that would rival those available in the city. 
        Electric and water companies were formed, roads were macadamized (packed 
        stone), drainage pipes installed and sidewalks of heavy wooden planks 
        were laid on the main streets. A two-story brick school was built for 
        over 100 students at the corner of Harvey and Concord streets replacing 
        the small wooden single room building. It stands today. The crowning glory 
        was the construction of the town hall at Main and Hawthorne, complete 
        with prisoner cells in the basement.</p>
      <p>During this period the community was comprised mainly of workers in various 
        trades servicing the city and the railroad activities. Brickyards, slaughterhouses 
        and market gardens in the northern part were interspersed with residential 
        dwellings. As the population grew, more residential areas were created 
        south of Clegg St. replacing the market garden farms.</p>
      <p><br>
        The Village of Ottawa East is annexed</p>
      <p>Finally in 1907 pressure for annexation from the city overcame the desire 
        of the village to remain distinct. Newspaper accounts detail &quot;a vision 
        for a greater Ottawa&quot;. The Ottawa Journal described the little village 
        as &quot;a most desirable area&quot; with &quot;good waterworks and streets 
        in admirable condition . . . well situated with industrial sites adjacent 
        to the canal and rail&quot;. With the promise of no new taxes for 8 years, 
        residents relented and in December of 1907 the Village of Ottawa East 
        was annexed and ceased to exist.</p>
      <p>This began the second phase of evolution of the community. No longer 
        political distinct from the city, residents demanded increased services 
        including a bridge. In 1915 the construction of Pretoria Bridge created 
        an explosion of industrial and residential development in the Ottawa East 
        area. In the north a massive rail complex was created centered on the 
        'round house' which was surrounded by rail yards and shops. This serviced 
        the growing transportation and fuel needs of the city. A huge gas storage 
        tank and tar works were constructed at the end of Lees Ave. Warehouses, 
        dairies, bakeries and slaughterhouses operated side by side with new housing. 
        As the federal government developed roads along both sides of the Rideau 
        Canal, this area became populated with professionals who worked in the 
        city. New plans of subdivision were registered in the southern part of 
        Ottawa East and agricultural land was turned into homes - a process that 
        continued well into the 1950's.</p>
      <p>The increasing population continued to mirror the original diverse cultural 
        mosaic. This was reflected in the building of the numerous churches and 
        schools to service French and English, Protestant and Catholic. The historical 
        presence of the Oblate Fathers expanded with the development of St Paul's 
        University? A new college (St. Pat's) was built on Patterson's Field in 
        1929. </p>
      <p>Main Street from Echo Drive to Herridge St. was a continuous strip of 
        businesses that served almost every need. One could buy fresh meat at 
        Hawley's Butcher Shop, a new dress at Antoine's, a football at Guzzo's 
        Sport Shop, have bread delivered to your door from Walker's Bread and 
        your wedding announcements printed at Nofke Press. All within walking 
        distance. The age of the strip mall and chain stores had not yet arrived. 
        People shopped, worked and lived in the community.</p>
      <p>In the 60's however, pressures from growth of the larger region eventually 
        caught up with the community. The movement of suburbanites in and out 
        of the city core became more important than preservation of the community. 
        The removal of the railway industry and the building of Queensway effectively 
        covered over a major portion of what was Old Ottawa East. Gone were the 
        railway yards and the industrial land (now the Nicholas St. interchange) 
        in the northeast. Wildwood Avenue and half of Ballantyne Park became a 
        commuter lane. Main Street was widened and, with the building of the Smyth 
        Road Bridge, became a major arterial road servicing the communities south 
        of the Rideau River. This, as well as other forces of progress, significantly 
        reduced the commercial aspect of the area. And this reduction of the community 
        may continue, as there are future plans to further pave over even more 
        significant portions!</p>
      <p>The last two decades have seen a slow revitalization of the area with 
        an increase in businesses, growth of educational institutions and the 
        development of condominium housing in the northeast adjacent to the canal. 
        Now predominately a residential area, the last vestiges of the original 
        industrial activities have long since disappeared. </p>
      <p>There are still many who remember the Old Ottawa East. But many more 
        are not aware how this unique community came into existence. To rectify 
        this situation and to permanently record the memories that will be lost, 
        the Ottawa East History Project has come into being. In the next several 
        issues of the Mainstreeter the history of the community will be documented 
        with articles on the people, industries and institutions that originally 
        created the community. This work and much more will be eventually published 
        on CD-ROM and available free to all community association members.</p>
