      John Conrad Bower, a gentleman' of the Village of Ottawa East, wrote his 
      will 100 years ago, in 1896. It cost him $1.80 to have it drawn up by lawyers. 
      Mr. Bower eventually died in 1907. The will passed into the possession of 
      Liz Fulton's father, another Ottawa East resident; and Liz thought that 
      it would be interesting to share this historical document. 
      <p>The house in which Bower lived had grounds that were &quot;fronting on 
        the Rideau River<br>
        ...[and] lying on the east side of the Rideau Canal&quot;. The house is 
        now known as 3 Bower. It had been built for Bower upon his retirement 
        in 1867. According to a reproduction 1876 map provided by Robert Bourbeau, 
        there were three houses clustered in an otherwise empty Ottawa East. These 
        houses were 3 Bower, 555 Echo, and another dwelling down by the canal, 
        where<br>
        Colonel By Drive now exists.</p>
      <p>Bower's wife, Catherine, was to get the bulk of the estate including 
        the house, personal property, and &quot;all money in any Bank&quot;. The 
        daughter, Sarah Elizabeth, was unmarried in 1896 and was to have &quot;a 
        reasonable share of the house say at three rooms&quot;, so she would have 
        a home to live in if she remained unmarried. She also received her bedroom 
        set, her bed, her bedding, and a quarter acre lot next to the&quot;Macadamized 
        Road&quot; (which might have been Mutchmor). [Editor's Note: the Macadamized 
        road was the name that Main St. had early on]</p>
      <p>The sons of John Bower, named Ira Bower, Albert Bower, and, curiously, 
        John Campbell, did not receive much of anything in this will. Albert had 
        already received &quot;his full share when and after he got married&quot;. 
        If the female Bowers died, then Ira and John split the estate and each 
        was to give to Albert the princely sum of $10. Presumably in 1896 this 
        amounted to more than the price of a lunch.</p>
      <p>Ira was to share the Bower house with his sister Sarah Elizabeth after 
        their mother's death but only &quot;as long as they can agree&quot;.</p>
      <p>I would be interested in confirming where all these people lived. I tried 
        to trace back the history of several older Ottawa East houses, in the 
        expectation that the four Bower children would have settled locally, but 
        my inquiries did not result in any other confirmed Bower residences. If 
        any readers know more of local history, perhaps they could share it with 
        us.</p>
