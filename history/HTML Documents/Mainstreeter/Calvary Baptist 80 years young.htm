      &quot;I love to go to church' says 95 year old Mrs Maude Abolit of Bower 
      Street. &quot;This is my church. I'll come as long as I'm able,&quot; she 
      adds. Indeed, it is. the only church Mrs Abolit has been a member of in 
      her life. She was one of the founding members of Calvary Baptist Church 
      when it was officially organized as a church in 1915.<br>
      ,.<br>
      Calvary Baptist's history goes back to the year 1903 when a mission was 
      begun in a tent on a lot at the corner of Main and Hawthorne Streets, later 
      called Ballantyne Park&quot; In September of that same year a community 
      mission was begun across the street in what was then Ottawa City Hall,<br>
      on the north east corner. Out of these two efforts, the Ottawa East Baptist 
      Mission was formed.<br>
      Then in 1908, the Ottawa Baptist Churches Board -which had formed the previous 
      year to help co-ordinate local mission activity in the Ottawa area purchased 
      a lot at the corner of Main and Evelyn Streets for the Ottawa East Baptist 
      Mission. Soon after a building was erected and the work was carried out 
      by local supply-preachers and student-pastors.<br>
      . .<br>
      In 1911, Rev. A. N. Frith became the first regular mission pastor and the 
      work 
      <p>Then in 1908, the Ottawa Baptist Churches Board which had formed the 
        previous year to help co-ordinate local mission activity in the Ottawa 
        area purchased a lot at the corner of Main and Evelyn Streets for the 
        Ottawa East Baptist Mission.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Soon after a building was erected and the work was carried out by local 
        supply-preachers and student-pastors.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In 1911, Rev. A. N. Frith became the first regular mission pastor and 
        the work flourished under his ministry. By the year 1915 it became apparent 
        that the work was strong enough to be established as a self supporting 
        church. Mrs. Abolit remembers well the day of April 22, 1915, when she 
        and 62 other charter members gathered to officially organize the Ottawa 
        East Baptist Mission as &quot;Calvary Baptist Church.&quot; She also can 
        still recall some of the sermons of Rev. G. H. Harber who served as the 
        first pastor until 1921. Over the years Mrs Abolit has seen a number of 
        pastors come and go. All have faithfully preached the Word of God, she 
        affirms.</p>
      <p>Pastor Bob McRoberts, the present pastor, notes that there have been 
        only nine senior pastors (there have been summer and youth pastors from 
        time to time) to serve the church during those 80 years. &quot;This testifies 
        well to the strength, stability and affirming nature of the congregation,&quot; 
        says Pastor McRoberts.</p>
      <p>85 year old Howard Harris, who also has been a member of the church for 
        many years, observes that from its inception, &quot;Calvary Baptist has 
        accentuated the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ which is still 
        'the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes. &quot;Mr. Harris 
        notes with great joy that: &quot;from its earliest years Calvary Baptist 
        has also been on the forefront in its endeavour to spread the Gospel around 
        the world. Many pastors, missionaries, and spouses of these ambassadors 
        for Christ, have gone out from this church. As well, the church has stood 
        financially and prayerfully behind many others.&quot; he remarks.<br>
      </p>
      <p>For many years, Calvary Baptist broadcast a radio program in the Ottawa 
        area.<br>
        Calvary Baptist, which takes a strong stand on the inspiration of the 
        Bible, is identified with the &quot;Fellowship of Evangelical Baptist 
        Churches in Canada.&quot;</p>
      <p>The &quot;Vision 2000&quot; movement a year ago recognized this denomination 
        as the fastest growing denomination in Canada during the 1990's.<br>
      </p>
      <p>As one drives past the church at 107 Main Street, the observer might 
        note that the building is not the most impressive of structures. The present 
        building dates to 1910. with major internal renovations completed in 1948, 
        and an addition added along the east side in 1960. But stepping<br>
        inside, a person is greeted with warmth and friendliness. The vibrancy 
        and intensity of worship and music followed by clear teaching from the 
        Bible far and away makes up for any lack of outward appearance. One individual 
        recently remarked, referring to the fellowship in worship and teaching 
        in the church, &quot;This is the best kept secret in Ottawa:&quot; The 
        church also serves it soup and sandwich. luncheon) in its lower auditorium 
        each Sunday.<br>
      </p>
      <p>As Mrs Abolit casts her eyes around during a recent morning worship service 
        at CaIvary, she could not help but think how different the texture of 
        the congregation presently is from the year 1915. A mosaic of nations 
        fills the pews: those from the Philippines, Jiunaica,Barbados,<br>
        Antigua, Guyana, Brazil, Rumania, Sri Lanka, China, Lebanon, Malaysia, 
        Cambodia, Uganda. A lady from Nigeria, dressed in her colourful native 
        dress leads part of the service. A group of children sings a chorus. The 
        pastor asks where each one was born. Only one names Canada as<br>
        her country of birth. </p>
      <p>&quot;I'll keep coming as, long as I'm able&quot;, says Mrs. Abolit, 
        almost every Sunday, And she'd love to welcome you too. She's looking 
        for someone to beat her record of 80 years in one church.<br>
