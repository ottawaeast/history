      <p>In the next few issues, the Mainstreeter would like to feature some of 
        the aspects of St. Paul University, a major institution in Ottawa East. 
        Many residents know very little about its activities and programmes. At 
        the heart of every educational institution is its library. In this issue 
        we focus on the library of St. Paul University.</p>
      <p><b>A Little Known Resource</b></p>
      <p>St. Paul University is one of North America's richest literary resources 
        for the subjects of theology, philosophy and medieval studies. It is Canada's 
        largest theological research library. Scholar's from all over the world 
        come to our community to use this magnificent collection. Medievalists 
        and philosophy professors from nearby universities find it an invaluable 
        resource.</p>
      <p>The collection supports the different disciplines offered at the University: 
        Theology, Canon Law, Pas-toral Studies, History of the Church, Philosophy, 
        Social Communications, Mission Studies and Counseling.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Sometimes St. Paul's own students do not recognize its value. One local 
        doctoral student left Ottawa to do his research at Harvard University 
        and in Strasbourg. &quot;When he returned,&quot; recalls Barbara Hicks, 
        the Chief Librarian, &quot;he discovered that all the resources he had 
        required were here.&quot;</p>
      <p>The library was started by Father Jean-Lean Allie in April of 1937, to 
        sup-port the St. Paul Seminary. Father Allie, who began his work as a 
        teacher of theology, was Chief Librarian until 1979, and continues selecting 
        books to this day. Now an energetic 78 year-old, he reports that &quot;as 
        long as your health is good, and your boss wants to keep you, staff are 
        not required to retire at 65 at St. Paul University.&quot; St. Paul University 
        was once the theological arm of the University of Ottawa, which became 
        of a provincial university in 1965. St. Paul University was then retained 
        by the Oblate order of the Catholic Church. Since then, the university 
        has been privately funded, with the assistance of some provincial funds.</p>
      <p>Father Allie recalls many famous Canadians who came to study philosophy 
        and to use the library at St. Paul's. Among them were Guy Sylvestre, the 
        National Librarian, Jean Luc Pepin, who held several federal cabinet posi-tions, 
        Jean-Jacques Bertrand, premier ,of Quebec, and &quot;&quot;Vincent Massey, 
        Governor General of Canada.</p>
      <p>The library philosophy has always been to build for tomorrow'. It has 
        been' developed as a &quot;research centre&quot;, not a: lending library. 
        &quot;When we decided to have an open' library, where students could access 
        books on the open shelves, people were shocked - it was revolutionary,&quot; 
        says Father Allie. The collection is unlike most university libraries--&quot;we 
        do not qrder duplicates or textbooks,&quot; says Father Allie. &quot;In 
        fact, approximately 80 per cent of the books are not used by undergradu-ate 
        students.&quot; The university has a high per-centage of students at post-graduate 
        levels.</p>
      <p><b>The Collection</b></p>
      <p>The collection contains over 350,000 volumes including approximately 
        3,500 titles. which are rare books published prior to 1800. The library 
        also houses some 1,100 current periodical subscriptions, including complete 
        runs of journals that are much appreciated by scholars. All of the major 
        western European languages are represented.<br>
      </p>
      <p>In the mid-1940s Father Allie visited several European countries to purchase 
        books for the library. Special collections come on sale with the closing 
        of religious institutions. In 1970, the Italian government forced the 
        closing of some institutions, releasing some libraries for sale. Recently, 
        a 4,000 volume library from Victoria, B.C. became available. He is always 
        seeking new additions for the collection, also purchasing books through 
        antiquarian dealers' catalogues, and other regular book trade sources.</p>
      <p>&quot;The University allocates 12 per cent of its budget to the library,&quot; 
        says Barbara Hicks. Very few universities support their libraries as well.</p>
      <p><b>Users</b></p>
      <p>The library is open to faculty and students of St. Paul University. Other 
        researchers, students and members of the public doing personal research 
        may use the library, with permission from the Chief Librarian. Only faculty 
        members may borrow books. Photocopying services are available in the library.</p>
      <p><b>Physical Aspects</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>St. Paul's is a traditional library in many respects. It is noticeably 
        quiet: in fact, the brochure for students warns, &quot;SILENCE - always 
        and everywhere.&quot; The card catalogue is not automated, but it is specially 
        indexed with access by author, title, subject and classification number. 
        This latter aspect is unique to St. Paul's, and because it brings together 
        subjects, without respect for lan-guage, it is very useful in a bilingual 
        institution.</p>
      <p>The library is bright, spacious and orderly, with many reference tables 
        and study carrels. Large windows overlook the University's beautiful grounds 
        and the Rideau River.</p>
      <p>The. Saint Paul University Library is for serious study, and a trea-sure 
        for those who are concerned with its special subjects. Although it is 
        only open to the public by special request, it is interesting to know 
        that this important research collection is in our midst.<br>
