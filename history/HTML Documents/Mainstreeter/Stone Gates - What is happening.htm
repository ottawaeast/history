      <p>There have been a couple of public meetings during 2003 to discuss the 
        question of how to best save the Brantwood gates. This article is meant, 
        to give you a capsule summary of the meetings and of the plan for going 
        forward. You can expect follow up articles in the future with more details.</p>
      <p>The Brantwood Gates are in need of repair. There was a preliminary meeting 
        back on June 26th at the Old Town Hall with city staff where options and 
        issues were first introduced to a few members of the community. We had 
        tried to have a meeting on October 16th but failed to get word out in 
        time and to enough people to make that possible. The next real meeting 
        was on November 20th at Saint Paul University to get more input, from 
        neighbours directly affected. City staff responsible for heritage and 
        property management were there to gather community input on alternatives.

      <p>From the meetings here is a summary of the issues as they were presented 
        to us:</p>
      <p>- The gates were originally build in 1912 by a developer to promote the 
        Brantwood development. They may not have been built to last. The developer 
        went out of business sometime later. </p>
      <p>- The gates became a war memorial in 1948 (partly as a community response 
        to save them). </p>
      <p>- The gates have since been officially designated as heritage property 
        of the City of Ottawa.</p>
      <p>-The heritage designation recognizes the gates 'as unique architectural 
        elements in conjunction with where they are. Their role as a gateway to 
        the community along with the stones and mortar are essential parts of 
        the heritage designation.<br>

    <td colspan="2"> 
      <p>- Some of the masonry has been crumbling and stones have been falling 
        out. This is due to a combination of salt spray, moisture penetration, 
        freezing, and road vibration. When the gates were originally built, Main 
        Street was a two lane road with much much less traffic. </p>
      <p>- There is some question about the foundations (one is cracked). <br>
      </p>
      <p>- Patching the stone work will not permanently fix the crumbling problem 
        and it will get worse putting the gates and people at risk. </p>
      <p>- The gates could be rebuilt. The existing exterior stones, plaques and 
        decorative caps would be re-used. The interior, which is suspected to 
        be rubble, and the foundations would replaced with modem materials.</p>
      <p>- The cost of rebuilding the gates could be very high and well beyond 
        the current city budget for this project. .</p>
      <p>- If that large an amount of money is spent, it might be best to move 
        the gates further away from Main Street to protect the investment because 
        proximity to Main is part of the problem, Moving as little as 10 feet 
        down Beckwith would be a good idea to help preserve them. Once they are 
        being rebuild there would be minimal additional cost to moving them.</p>
      <p>- They could also be moved to another location in the neighbourhood if 
        people have another preferred location away from the traffic on Main.</p>
      <p>- If they move, they may not retain their heritage designation.</p>
      <p>At the November 20th meeting the issues and options were discussed with 
        people from the neighbourhood. Moving the gates even just a little raised 
        many concerns and fears. Doing nothing or just trying to patch the mortar 
        wasn't seen as sufficient. The remaining option of having the gates rebuilt 
        in exactly the same location was the one most people could live with. 
        With that option in mind, we need to help the city raise sufficient funds 
        for the project. A few participants at the meeting agreed to start the 
        process to get this project going. In the coming months you can expect 
        to hear more about the gates and the fundraising plan. If you'd like to 
        help save the gates you can contact Pierre Johnson at 234-1151. Stay tuned.<br>
