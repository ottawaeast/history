        Ottawa' Rough Riders and Tony Golab, an all-star with the Riders, claimed 
        that no one ever tackled him as hard as &quot;Soggy&quot;. Judge Ed Houston, 
        a long-time friend, des-cribed ,&quot;Soggy&quot; as a truly remarkable 
        strong person but with a tender heart and more than just a passing, interest 
        in his fellow man. &quot;Soggy&quot; ended his career in Ottawa as an 
        industrious<br>
