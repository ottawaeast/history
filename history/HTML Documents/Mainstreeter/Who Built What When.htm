      &quot;Then look at any map of Ottawa and try to find - if you can - any 
      section in the city which can possibly offer the advantages in distance 
      from the city's centre, - natural scenic beauty and general desirability 
      of this charming spot. There is no other - this is the last and best.&quot; 
      - Brantwood Place brochure, circa 1912 
      <p>Speaking as a relatively new home-owner to this&quot; last, and best&quot; 
        residential area, I had often wondered what was the progression of house 
        building in Ottawa East. Did it develop uniformly, as one can see the 
        suburbs of Orleans and Kanata grow now? There are some areas of Ottawa 
        East where this seemed possible, as there is an ob-vious regularity of 
        styles of construc-tion. Yet there are also older farm-type houses that 
        sit unique among their neighbours, and sections of the commu-nity that 
        are non-uniform.</p>
      <p>Local residents were a big help in sort-ing out the details. The City 
        of Ottawa also opened their computerized database to me, and created a 
        listing of the age of houses on each block. The results are shown on the 
        maps.</p>
      <p>The first map gives the construction dates of various parts of the area, 
        marked for those sections that are largely built in the same decade. This 
        is generally the south and east edges of Ottawa East. The central area, 
        north of Clegg Street to just north of the Queensway, is much harder to 
        typify, as each block contains buildings of many different eras. Consider 
        the one-block-square section at the junction of Clegg and Main Streets 
        boxed at the right of the first map. The city computer lists all 16 houses 
        on this block by the decade of their construction. In 10 of the last 12 
        decades, since 1870, someone has built a house here. If anyone would like 
        to see this printout, please contact me care of the Mainstreeter.</p>
      <p>Essentially, the area was settled by farmers and small landowners, as 
        well as various religious orders. The names of the original landowners 
        live on in the street names - Brown, Lees, Graham, Bower and others. Some 
        of the houses of these settlers are still promi-nently standing, overshadowing 
        their next-door neighbours.</p>
      <p><br>
        The Village of Archville, once located in the area of the present site 
        of the Ottawa East sector of the Queensway, became the Village of Ottawa 
        East, then was annexed to Ottawa early in the 1900s. It had its commercial 
        section on Main Street near the Old Town Hall.</p>
      <p>Let. us look at more specific areas, such as shown in the<a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_OE_Fugler_development.jpg"> 
        hand-drawn map</a>. &quot;The Pines&quot; was the family home of the Browns, 
        and before its demolition in 1974, it was located where the Cuban Embassy 
        now squats. &quot;The Pines&quot; was built before there were any other 
        houses<br>
        to the south; the Browns had a clear view of the Rideau River. Down at 
        the Canal end of their property was a boat factory, making small craft 
        for those using the canal. On some days the Browns found the smell from 
        the Slat-terys' smokehouse quite strong.</p>
      <p>Editor's Note: The original hand-drawn map was scanned at the original 
        size and <a href="../Image%20Library/Maps/M_OE_Fugler_development.jpg">can 
        be seen here</a>.</p>
      <p>Slattery, Ottawa's largest meat supplier in the early 1900s, kept sheep 
        on the fields which lay to the south of Present day Clegg Street. Slattery's 
        house still sits between Riverdale and Mount Pleasant Avenues, and was 
        a noted landmark even at the turn of the century.</p>
      <p>As each landowner sold off his hold-ings, the blocks were developed, 
        much the same as rural Ottawa is now being absorbed. One part of Ottawa 
        East that took some time to grow was the Brantwood Park vicinity. The 
        great stone gates at Beckwith and Main were built to welcome the influx 
        of investors searching for &quot;exclusiveness, proximity, and desirability 
        guaranteed for all time&quot;, as the promotional brochure ex-tolled. 
        Stringent regulations regarding the minimum building costs, exterior finish 
        and distance from the stable would make this area &quot;a new high class 
        residential section&quot;. Unfortunately the initial development did not 
        attract sufficient numbers of far-sighted buyers, and the area was not 
        developed until several decades later.<br>
        <br>
        The pleasure of doing this brief synopsis of local history was in talking 
        to people, some of whom could easily recall sufficient historical material 
        to merit a book. My thanks to Susan and Betty Hill, Bill Smith, Laine 
        Wyman of the City of Ottawa, and others. If any readers would like more 
        detail on any of the points raised, let me know and I can elaborate in 
        a future article.</p>
