      For two brothers, Arthur Winges, 87, and Gerhardt Winges (Gai), 81, Ottawa 
      East has always been home. They agree it a pleasant place to live, among 
      family and friends of many years, and alive with memories of their happy 
      childhood. 
      <p>They were born in the attractive white house at 228 Main Street, corner 
        of Herridge and Main, where Arthur still lives, now with his daughter 
        Gloria and son-in-law Garry Ryan. Arthur is a widower now. Gai lives on 
        Springhurst Avenue with his wife</p>
      <p>The house where Arthur and Gai and their five sisters and four bro-thers 
        were born was built in<a href="../Image%20Library/People/X_Winges%20Arthur%20Gai%20article.jpg"><img src="../Image%20Library/People/sm/X_Winges%20Arthur%20Gai%20article_sm.jpg" width="200" height="135" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="Arthur and Gai Winges" border="0"></a> 
        the 1880s by their father, Wilhelm with help from several friends in the 
        district. He came to Ottawa East from Trusetal, Germany, and was married 
        to Henrieta Stolzman in Ottawa.</p>
      <p>Originally the house was fifteen feet longer than it appears today, and 
        included a summer kit-chen, a familiar and convenient adjunct to houses 
        in those days. Over the summer kitchen was an unheated room where their 
        own smoked meats were hung, and where vegetables and fruit were stored 
        for winter use.</p>
      <p><b>Main street Then</b></p>
      <p>Main street was an earthen road when they were young, dry and dusty in 
        summer, muddy when it rained and rut-ted and snow-filled in winter. There 
        were wooden plank sidewalks. The street was lined with shade trees and 
        bushes along much of its length, with wooden and brick houses - some of 
        which survive today, and many with white picket fences. A pretty little 
        town, they remember.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Horse-drawn buggies and wagons proceeded at a leisurely pace where now 
        motor-cars, trucks and buses speed madly along. They remember another 
        kind of Main street than the one we know today.</p>
      <p><b>Blacksmith Shop and other</b>s</p>
      <p>There was a blacksmith shop on Main, opposite Oblate Avenue. Here Arthur 
        age nine got his &quot;first job&quot;. He relates, &quot;I thought I'd 
        like a job - one that I'd be paid for.&quot; So I asked for work at the 
        blacksmith shop and spent the morning sweeping out. And for my morning's 
        work got one cent in pay. I didn't go back in the afternoon - that seemed 
        to be that!&quot; .</p>
      <p>Near Hurdman's Bridge on the Rideau River was an abattoir which supplied 
        meat to the district families. &quot;We often saw Main street thronged 
        with cattle off-loaded from the railway at Harvey street and herded down 
        to their fate,&quot; they recall.</p>
      <p>The Old Town Hall was built in 1895 to serve as headquarters of municipal 
        and local government and had a jail cell in the basement. In addition, 
        the building was a rendezvous for public meetings and social gatherings, 
        and held the first public school kindergarten.</p>
      <p><br>
        The Canada and Atlantic railway line crossed Main at Harvey street, and 
        around it was the commercial area: a Nova Scotia Bank building, grocery 
        and hardware stores, barber and butcher shops to serve the needs of the 
        growing community.</p>
      <p><b>Church Properties</b></p>
      <p>Across from the Winges home were, and are, what is referred to locally 
        as the &quot;church proper-ties&quot; where St. Paul's University is located. 
        Arthur spoke of a great oak tree right across the street and still visible 
        from his living room windows. &quot;One day when I was a boy, I saw that 
        tree planted, and never thought that that tree and I would grow old together. 
        It has seen a lot of summers, but then I guess, So have I,&quot; he laughs.</p>
      <p><b>Slattery's Field</b></p>
      <p>South of their house on Main was an area of orchards and pasture know 
        as Slattery's Field. Now it is filled with neat attractive houses; streets 
        and crescents run down to the Canal. In the Winges's youth it was a &quot;playground&quot; 
        where they played their games of Hide-and-Seek, ball and fort building. 
        They &quot;helped themselves&quot; to apples and had wonderful times.</p>
      <p>Arthur and Gai agree their leisure time was full of fun and child-hood 
        games, sports, picnics and visiting back and forth with cousins and friends. 
        &quot;We were always busy. I never remember being bored in our quiet times. 
        There were books to read, studying to do. We had good lives, and still 
        do, for that matter,&quot; they claim. Gai remembers the brickyard south 
        of the &quot;church properties&quot; on the east side of Main and opposite 
        Slattery's Field, (from about Clegg street to Beckwith Road by today's 
        measure). Bricks for homes and buildings in Ottawa and Ottawa East were 
        made there. Clay was quar-ried from the yard and fired into bricks in 
        the huge kiln that extended from Main to the Rideau River.</p>
      <p>&quot;I learned to swim in one of the great holes quarried from the ground,&quot; 
        he says. But the serious swimming for children was, of course, at Brantwood 
        Beach. &quot;We thought the glorious days of swimming and fishing at Brantwood 
        would never end,&quot; Gai says. &quot;We had little knowledge or even 
        thought of pollution in those days.&quot; He added that he &quot;feels 
        rather sorry for today's children&quot; denied the simple pleasure of 
        swimming in their own Rideau River.</p>
      <p>In the Spring the Winges children would watch ice being cut from the 
        Ri-deau into huge chunks and stored in huts for needed &quot;refrigeration&quot; 
        of early days: When ice was needed the blocks would be distributed in 
        ice wagons and &quot;it was fun sneaking rides on the wagon and, with 
        our pocket knives, hacking off bits of ice from the blocks to suck as 
        we rode gleefully home in style.&quot;</p>
      <p><b>A Long Walk</b></p>
      <p>Arthur and Gai, (with their cousins, school mates and sisters) walked 
        across the railway track, and past many of the shops on their way to school. 
        And it was a long walk: down Main street, Greenfield to Nelson, and up 
        the steep hill to their school, St Paul's Lutheran at Nelson and Laurier. 
        &quot;I don't remember thinking it. was too long, every-body walked to 
        school in<br>
        those days, and we accepted it as part of our lives.&quot;</p>
      <p>The family went to church at St.Paul's Lutheran at Wilbrod and King Edward. 
        &quot;I learned my catechism in both German and English,&quot; Arthur 
        remembers.</p>
      <p><b>Not All Play</b></p>
      <p>It was not all play for the children when they were home from school 
        - there were chores to be done. Garden work was constant from early Spring 
        planting through Summer and Fall. Weeding the garden, tending the apple 
        trees, situa-ted in the lot just north of the home, was day-by-day work 
        to ensure an efficient garden plot. Vegetables and fruits from the well-laden 
        gardens that fed them all summer were harvested and stored for winter 
        eating.</p>
      <p>&quot;We had berries from the garden for our fruit treats, and apples 
        to munch and to enjoy made<br>
        into pies. Mother was a wonderful cook and never made just one pie.&quot; 
        Arthur remembers.. &quot;She always made a dozen or so and' they made 
        wonderful table fare for us all.</p>
      <p>&quot;Women had to be efficient cooks and bakers then and Mother was 
        certainly in that cate-gory. We were particu-larly fond of a sweet bread 
        she used to bake, called 'Kuchen'. This had a wonderful sugar topping 
        made with fruit, a supreme joy to eat. We all loved it and still have 
        the pans, fifteen by eighteen inches, that she use to make it,&quot; Arthur 
        relates.</p>
      <p>&quot;And there were animals to tend - a pig and a cow, and usually chickens. 
        We never seemed to find time hanging heavily on our hands. Our parents 
        saw to that and, again, like walking to school, just part of a day's routine. 
        &quot;We never thought we were put-upon by our tasks. The chores were 
        there and we did them. It was as simple as that.&quot;</p>
      <p><b>The Coming of Winter</b></p>
      <p>As with all families early in the century, the Winges's plans for winter 
        had to be made and tasks completed well before the first snow-fall. Wood 
        had to be cut or bought, coal &quot;in&quot; and the home secured against 
        winter cold.</p>
      <p>&quot;We would buy a pig, usually one that weighed about 125 pounds, 
        but-cher it, have the meat cut and smoked it in our smoke house,&quot; 
        Arthur recalls and says it &quot;cost about $7.50 in those<br>
        days. We bought potatoes in 100 pound bags and we needed about 15 bags 
        to last the winter - they cost 35 cents a bag. Of course, staples - salt, 
        sugar, coffee etc. - were available at local stores.&quot; With our stocks 
        of garden produce we were fairly well supplied for winter.</p>
      <p><b>The Garden</b></p>
      <p>The present garden, as it did in former years, comprises the whole lot 
        adjacent to and just north of the house. In Spring, Summer and Fall it 
        is a neighbourhood showplace of beauty and delight, the personal creation 
        of Arthur, Gloria and Garry. Flowers, stone paths, lawns and hedges, a 
        trellis-walled gazebo next to the house, the pristine white of the buildings 
        present a scene of beauty to the family, neighbours and passerby.</p>
      <p>Arthur and Gai Winges supplied us with such a wealth of information on 
        their early life in Ottawa East that we de-cided to make a special feature 
        of their story. The next issue of the MainStreeter will des-cribe their 
        games and activities and the one following, a tour of Main Street, 1914.</p>
