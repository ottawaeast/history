      This is the third in a series of features about the Winges family and the 
      early days in Ottawa East, (circa 1914) as told to Dorotby HeIferty by Artbur 
      Winges and the late Gai Winges. 
      <p><b>Special Events</b></p>
      <p>The Rideau Aquatic Canoe Club races on the Rideau Canal were a big event. 
        They took place between the Bank Street and Pretoria Bridges. St. Paul's 
        Lutheran Church Annual Picnic took place on the Rideau River, just south 
        of where the hydro power lines cross the river. All kinds of games, races, 
        and contests were held.</p>
      <p>Corpus Christi was an elaborate religious parade held by the French Roman 
        Catholics in Ottawa East. It started at the Scholasti-cate, the stone 
        building near Oblate Avenue, set way back from Main Street. The parade 
        route was marked by poles with colourful banners on them, set at the sidewalk 
        curb. A house would be selected and ornately decorated as the focal point 
        of the parade. The clergy and parishioners would walk from the Scholasticate 
        through the streets to the shrine house and return singing and chan- ting 
        as they walked. It was very colourful and interesting (no vandalism to 
        the decorations on the route).</p>
      <p><b>Annual Exhibition</b></p>
      <p>This ten-day affair was always an event to look forward to. If you had 
        an extra nickel, you would take a rowboat ferry across the Canal from 
        the end of Herridge Street, to save walking up to Pretoria Bridge and 
        back along the other side. It was especially welcome at night when you 
        went home very tired. Our Ex spending money was earned at the Ex. The 
        cattle, horses and other livestock were unloaded at the Elgin Street railway 
        station and cattle yard, located in the area where the Metcalfe (East) 
        on-ramp to the Queensway is now. To get them to the Exhibition Grounds 
        we would lead one or two animals at a time, by the halter, down Metcalfe 
        Street, which ran to the Ex grounds. For that you got a quarter, maybe 
        fifty cents. For two weeks afterwards your arm was numb, and your feet 
        were sore. Compare that to a $10 grass-cutting job <br>
        today. Sometimes we got pocket money by collecting bottles, old iron, 
        etc., to sell to roaming rag beggars.</p>
      <p><b>Main Street - 1914</b></p>
      <p>Here's a tour up Main Street, as we remember it. Let's start, say, in 
        1914, at the corner where Riverdale Avenue comes into Main Street at the 
        south end. Main Street from this intersection south to the river was just 
        a weed-filled right-of-way for many years. Travelling north from the corner, 
        there was a beautiful home on the east-side of Main, (Mr. Turner's, still 
        existing) and &quot;The Pines,&quot; a grand old house on the west side 
        (Mrs. Brown's, where now stands the Cuban Embassy). Newcome's white house 
        sat on the lane from Main to the Canal, next to &quot;The Pines.&quot; 
        Trick's garden was also situated on this lane.</p>
      <p>On to the Stone Pillars, with no other houses on either side until Clegg 
        Street and Slattery's Field, an open cattle field from Main Street to 
        Echo Drive. Main Street at this time was mostly gravel.<br>
        The centre, 15-foot strip was a liquid-applied tar surface. From the centre 
        strip to the sidewalk curb was grass and weeds. Traffic, both horse and 
        car, came from the area on the .other side of Billings Bridge (and still 
        does, multiplied many times).<br>
      </p>
      <p>From Clegg to Herridge, the west side of Main Street had houses, each 
        with garden lots beside them. Every house had a picket fence in front 
        of it. Houses continued on the west side up to Oblate Avenue. On the east 
        side, the Oblate property had a thorn hedge and no sidewalk. Wooden sidewalks 
        on the west side had just been replaced with concrete.</p>
      <p>About opposite 228 Main Street, the Oblates had a large gate into their 
        property, which led onto a curved path up to the grey stone Scholasticate. 
        Towering over this path, down either side, were &quot;cathedral- like&quot; 
        elm trees, about 60 to 70 feet high. The main entrance to St. Paul University 
        is<br>
        located there now. </p>
      <p>Continuing up Main, from Herridge to Hazel, (on the east, Oblate side) 
        was located a French Roman Catholic school, at demolished to make way 
        for the north wing s of St. Paul Seminary. From Hazel to Oblate Avenue 
        was an open field. On Oblate Avenue, set back from Main Street about 200 
        to 300 feet, was a French Roman Catholic church, now demolished. On the 
        west side, from Hazel almost up to Oblate, were more houses. A lumber 
        mill and a blacksmith shop ended the development at the south end of St. 
        Patrick's College property, now an Algonquin College parking area.</p>
      <p>From Oblate (east side) to the railway line (Queensway), Main was built 
        up with houses, and the Calvary Baptist Church.</p>
      <p><b>Old Town Hall</b></p>
      <p>The Town Hall on the corner of Main and Hawthorne was the council chamber 
        for the Village of Ottawa East, a meeting place, election poll and police 
        station - there was a jail cell in the basement, mostly for drunks. The 
        building housed a kindergarten and a French school for a time, and had 
        many other uses. It is a real landmark.<br>
      </p>
      <p>From the north of the Town Hall to the railway line was a row of small 
        stores -now long demolished. Business was good at that time: the Nova 
        Scotia Bank was located in this row in early days.</p>
      <p>Main Street, where the Queensway overpass is, was crossed by a railway 
        line. Trains from outside Ottawa were brought to Main Crossing to be &quot;switched 
        back&quot; to Union Station (the Conference Centre) on Rideau Street. 
        A switcher in a hut at the intersection of the rail line and Main lowered 
        a guard rail across the street to stop road traffic. This brought loud 
        protests and horn-honking from motorists. Some cars smashed through the 
        guard rails. Motorists would climb up to the switch cabin to threaten 
        the switcher or punch him if he was too slow.</p>
      <p><b>Pranks</b></p>
      <p>When you go along Harvey Street, north of the Main Street Queensway overpass, 
        and west of the bookstore and post office, continue to the Rideau Canal. 
        There was a wooden pedestrian bridge there, which was opened for water 
        traffic by a man-operated winch with a long handle. The little devil boys 
        used to hide the handle. So when a boat came along, there was panic for 
        a while, because boats had no brakes. After the bridge was rammed a few 
        times the. police caught up with the culprits. Oh, what simple fun in 
        the old days.</p>
      <p><b>Old Hotel</b></p>
      <p>At the top of Main Street, where it intersects Old Echo Drive and to 
        the east down toward Concord Street, was a Hotel. Farmers on their way 
        home from the market would stop at the Hotel for a few beers. Quite often 
        we would have two farmers racing down Main with their teams and wagons, 
        hell-bent for leather. We kids liked this.</p>
      <p><b>Everyday Events</b></p>
      <p>A fire in Ottawa East brought the fire engines up Main Street from Ottawa 
        South at break-neck speed. A huge boiler, to make steam pressure for the 
        high-pressure water pump, was supported on a wooden platform by large 
        wooden-spoked wheels, with hard rubber tires. The whole vehicle was a 
        highly enamelled red, with nickel trim, and drawn by beautiful, dapple-grey 
        horses, manes flowing, smoke belching from the coal fire in the boiler 
        - what a thrill.</p>
      <p>A more somber event was the horse &quot;death wagon,&quot; a long, low 
        wagon, big enough to fit the dead horses. Some of us followed the cart 
        to the end of Lees A venue where the animal was burned in a furnace with 
        a 5 to 6 foot-diameter chimney, very high, located at the east end of 
        Lees, near where the overpass bridge is.</p>
      <p><b>Main Street Cattle Drive</b></p>
      <p>Every so often a cloud of dust would appear at the south end of Main 
        Street (not totally paved). The cloud signaled that a herd of cattle, 
        10,20 or 30 of them, was being herded up Main to the Slattery's slaughterhouse, 
        about where Elliot Avenue is, at a spring halfway from Main to the Rideau 
        River. This always created excitement for us kids because some cows got 
        away and had to be rounded up. The cattle destroyed property as they went 
        along, and also left their &quot;trademarks&quot; on the street.</p>
      <p><b>Road Paving</b></p>
      <p>The road-paving days were &quot;Mother's breakdown days.&quot; Piles 
        of sand or gravel were dumped on the sidewalks every few feet. Next, a 
        horse-drawn tank, five feet in diameter by 10 or 12 feet long, would spew 
        hot tar from a pipe at the rear. This tar would be spread by men with 
        push brooms, followed quickly by a gang of men with shovels, spreading 
        the sand over the hot tar There was plenty of &quot;uncovered tar&quot; 
        for kids, people's shoes, carts, etc., to pick up and track into the house 
        for days after. Some streets wouldn't solidify for weeks.</p>
      <p><b>Electric Streetcars</b></p>
      <p>This also was a big treat; for a while the fare was 5 cents. From uptown 
        the route branched off Elgin Street at Argyle Avenue, went over Pretoria 
        Bridge, down Hawthorne Avenue then turned south on Main down to Clegg, 
        where it looped around, in that little park, and returned to Elgin Street. 
        This service did not last too many years, I don't know why. Summer service 
        was frequently interrupted by the Pretoria lift-bridge having to be raised 
        to let boat traffic pass under it.</p>
      <p><b>Farm Produce</b></p>
      <p>On farm market days, many farmers would sell all of their produce - potatoes 
        in 100-lb bags, milk, butter, fowl, meat cuts, live geese - right on Main 
        Street. People from the area would come up and bargain with them. Twenty 
        or 30 bags of potatoes would often end up in one house for a winter's 
        supply. Honey, eggs, real cream at 25 cents a quart, stove-wood, clothing 
        all were good buys on Main.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Walking along the east-side of the Rideau Canal was always interesting. 
        The shore was open (no concrete wall) from Bank Street bridge to Nicholas 
        Street. Low-lying places - Echo Drive and the end of Herridge and Hazel 
        Streets - were sometimes flooded over temporarily from high motorboat 
        waves.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Thoughts on Ottawa East and Main Street Today</b></p>
      <p><b>ArthurWinges:</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, we and many more Ottawa East residents have thoughts and ideas for 
        Main Street today, but we are fighting a non-elected Regional government 
        that seems determined to spend millions of our tax dollars to convert 
        Main Street into a high-speed roadway for people living miles away in 
        outlying developments to use as the shortest and quickest way to get to 
        centretown and home again.</p>
      <p>I feel Echo Drive, from Pretoria Bridge south to the Riverdale intersection, 
        should be widened to take two-way traffic.Yes, there are a few places 
        where it might be tight, but generally there is room, and today's engineers 
        can do anything.</p>
      <p>Remember, not long ago, Nicholas Street in front of the Ottawa U. buildings 
        was only a two-way street; they made it wider, and now it has tremendous 
        traffic volume.</p>
      <p>There were problems, like Colonel By Drive and the high embankment, but 
        concrete and steel can do it. Opening up Echo Drive would bring great 
        relief to Main Street.</p>
      <p><b>Gai Winges:</b><br>
      </p>
      <p>At 81 years, I look down Main Street and remember back - fond memories.</p>
      <p>Things have to change - even on Main. Some old homes are still there 
        as I remember them; some have been modified.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Not many of us oldies left now in Ottawa East to look down Main Street 
        in 1990. Do we like what we see? Good question. I like what I remember 
        better than what I see today. We hope that, someday, something will be 
        done to stop Main Street from being the heavy traffic short-cut for cars 
        from all other areas, ripping through Main to get downtown. Ottawa must 
        find a way to open up Echo Drive to through traffic - and it can be done.</p>
      <p><br>
        Nicholas Street in front of Ottawa U. is a good example where a narrow 
        street was widened without it affecting Colonel By Drive in any way. There 
        are just two places on Echo Drive that are narrow; the remainder to Pretoria 
        Bridge could easily be widened to reduce the heavy flow of traffic on 
        Main Street.</p>
      <p><b>A footnote:</b></p>
      <p>Mr. Gerhardt (Gai) Winges died recently in his 82nd year. His widow Verla 
        lives on Springhurst Avenue. The staff of the MainStreeter join the friends 
        and neighbours of the Wingeses in offering their condolences to Mrs. Winges 
        and to their two daughters, Susan Winges, in Vancouver, B.C..and Mrs. 
        Judy Galloway, in Nepean, Susan's husband, Keith Galloway, and their children. 
        Neil and Heather.</p>
      <p>Arthur's and Gai's sister Frieda, Mrs. M. Pillen, aged 90. lives in Provost. 
        Alberta.</p>
      <p>They were born in the attractive white house at 228 Main Street, corner 
        of Herridge and Main, where Arthur still lives, now with his daughter 
        Gloria and son-in-law Garry Ryan. Another daughter, Wanda, lives in Toronto. 
        Arthur, 88 was widowed in 1960.<br>
