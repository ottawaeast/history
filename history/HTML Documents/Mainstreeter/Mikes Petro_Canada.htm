      <p>FOR THE PAST 31 years, the Galazka family has operated Mike's Service 
        Centre on Main Street in our community of Ottawa East. Mike's FINA, as 
        some still prefer to think of the family -run operation, has always been 
        there to help Ottawa East residents whenever they needed great auto service 
        at a fair price. Whether it is Mike Senior, little Mike &quot;Junior&quot;, 
        Tom, Bob or any of the staff, you always know that you will be treated 
        fairly.</p>
      <p>It seems like just yesterday when, with great fanfare, Petro-Canada took 
        down the FINA sign and put up its own. To their valued clientele, it appeared 
        as though nothing had changed.</p>
      <p>Mike and his staff repaired only what was absolutely required. No extras 
        here. Bobby, who has been a permanent fixture at the station for even 
        more years than the Galazka family, continued to explain things with his 
        special charm. Both Mike Junior and Tom (John Walsh's son) followed in 
        their father's footsteps by working at Mike's and have worked together, 
        side by side, for almost 20 years. In addition to the regular staff, Mike's 
        has always provided a place where many area high school, students have 
        cut their teeth obtaining valuable work experience.</p>
      <p>But there was a difference. Petro-Canada had taken control of operations 
        behind the scenes. Even as Mike and his crew worked hard to keep Ottawa 
        East rolling along, Petro-Canada thought little of the old Ottawa East 
        station. Being a leased station, Petro-Canada was responsi-ble for maintaining 
        the property. They didn't. In fact, for several-months on end, they failed 
        even to send a company representative by to discuss day-to-day business 
        regarding the operation of the station.</p>
      <p>Recently, Petro-Canada decided it will only offer the Galazkas a one-year 
        lease on the property. This means that Mike and his crew, after over 31 
        years in the same location, face the real possibility that they may be 
        forced out of business next year at this time. Not only would this mean 
        job losses for staff, some of whom like Bobby have worked at the station 
        for almost 40 years. It would also be a loss for Ottawa East.</p>
      <p>In an effort to stop this from happening, Mike purchased the commercially 
        zoned property next door, at 123 Main Street. Mike approached City Hall 
        with a plan to construct a three-bay garage in the back of this property. 
        He required some exceptions from the zoning bylaw in order for the construction 
        to take place.<br>
        <br>
        Mike's application for a variance was approved on the spot by the Committee 
        of Adjustments on June 5.</p>
      <p>&quot;We received over 100 letters of support. The Committee members 
        said they had never seen anything like it. I think they were amazed,&quot; 
        Mike Junior reports. &quot;So thanks Ottawa East, for all of your support.&quot;</p>
      <p>This submission to the Mainstreeter was written by a Mike's Petro-Canada 
        customer.<br>
