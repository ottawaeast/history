      that year. The Directory provides a listing for all employed adults at a

      the family number (Fam). the Directory listing for the occupation has been 
      included only if it differs from that of the Census. To find more about 
      each family, consult the actual <a href="1901%20Ottawa%20East%20Census%20All%20Pages.htm">1901

      this writer was not able to unlock the mysteries of Excel spreadsheets and 
      therefore could not sort by street number. Nevertheless, with a little bit 
      of scrolling you will be able to see the entire street. Comparing addresses 
      today with buildings that existed in 1901, it appears that the numbers remained 
      the same in most cases.</td>

      <p>The ethnicity column from the original census was included to see if 
        there was any significant groupings in the community. Apart from the German 
        residents who settled in the Main, Glenora and Bronson area, there was 
        no pattern of significance.</p>
      <p>The occupation column shows that 66 of 394 adults (17%) listed in the 
        Directory were employed directly by the railroads, almost all of these 
        with the Canada Atlantic Railway at the massive 'round house' repair shop. 
        The same column also reveals that there were 21 widows in the village, 
        that's 5% of the total listing! </p>
