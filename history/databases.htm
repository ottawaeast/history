      <p>Over the course of the project several databases have been created to 
        assist in understanding the people of Ottawa East. As well it is hoped 
        that the data will assist future genealogists in the search for their 
        heritage. And for all those who predict a future of technical incompatibilities, 
        remember that techion particles have yet to be harnessed!</p>
      <p>Just skip through the pages as each offers an interesting and never-seen-before 
        view of the people who started the community. Put yourself in the place 
        of the people you read about here. Imagine yourself as Wilhelm Rhomhild, 
        a 22 year-old German immigrant, getting of the boat in 1889. Little English 
        and less money but smart and built like a brick privy. What do you do? 
        He, and hundreds of other stories can be explored with a little inductive 
        thinking and some columns of data.</p>
