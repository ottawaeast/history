      East and the railways. Cars speed past the community along the Queensway 
      that covers the right-of-way where a once-busy railway ran. In fact, much 
      of the growth of Ottawa in the late 1800s can be partly attributed to the 
      coming of the Canada Atlantic Railway in 1882 with lumber magnate J.R. Booth's 
      move into railway construction and ownership.</td>

    <td colspan="2">As the western terminus of Booth's railway was Ottawa when 
      construction was completed, facilities had to be built to service and maintain 
      the locomotives and cars. This meant the construction of a roundhouse and 
      repair shops. And so it was that the Canada Atlantic Railway (CAR) constructed 
      a five-stall roundhouse on the property where the apartment building stands 
      at the corner of Argyle and Elgin Street. Further west, a car shop was built 
      at about Metcalfe and Catherine Streets along with the CAR's railway station. 
      This shop built and repaired railway cars used by the company.</td>

    <td colspan="2">In the early days of the railways, the maintenance of cars 
      and locomotives was labour-intensive. Consequently there was a large workforce 
      and this workforce would live within walking distance. As well, the daily 
      preparation and maintenance of steam locomotives took a lot of people, from 
      boiler makers and pipe fitters, as the trades were called, to the engine 
      crew and hostlers (the men who moved the locomotives in and out of the roundhouse 
      and spotted them for loading coal and water). These workers would be a part 
      of the local community, including Ottawa East. </td>

      <p>Why did Booth select the Ottawa East area as the site for his railway 
        facilities? There are likely a number of reasons. First, the location 
        of the line was at the southern boundary of the city and yet close enough 
        to get business from the city. Secondly, the land was mainly open country 
        so would be cheap to purchase. As well, he could bring coal in on the 
        canal for the locomotives (there are photos showing piles of coal and 
        loaded barges along the canal) and there was the prospect of business 
        with the transfer of freight from barge to railcar for final delivery.<br>
