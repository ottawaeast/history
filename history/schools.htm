            <td colspan="2">The history of schools in Ottawa East directly reflected 
              the changing ethnic and linguistic composition of the community 
              over the years. As the numbers and resources of each community group 
              rose so did the needs for new or better educational facilities. 
              In the Nineteenth Century the ratepayers in Nepean Township funded 
              mainly public schools and there were few Separate Schools. In general 
              Protestants and Catholics, English and French studied together. 
              This began to change toward the end of the century as the number 
              of French-Canadian and Catholic families grew, particularly in the 
              Ottawa East area.<br>
              <br>
              In 1850 the Province of Ontario passed legislation that sectioned 
              Nepean Township into school areas whereby ratepayers would be taxed 
              in support of their local schools. Initially Ottawa East was part 
              of School Section #1 that covered a large part of the northeast 
              section of the township. By the 1870's, with significant population 
              growth in Archville (originally called the 'Deep Cut' in reference 
              to that part of the Rideau Canal) and Spenceville, a new section 
              was requested by the population. The community wanted more direct 
              control of their children's education and the convenience of a local 
              school. As well ratepayers objected to funding the education of 
              children from the squatters settlement along the canal who paid 
              no taxes.<br>
              <br>
              <b>First Public School in Ottawa East</b><br>
              <br>
              On April 22, 1875 Nepean Township Bylaw No. 243 was passed and this 
              provided for the borrowing of $800 for a new school house. On April 
              30, 1875, Bylaw No. 245 established School Section #17, which included 
              all of Ottawa East from Ann St. (Mann Ave.) to Elliot St. between 
              the Rideau River and the Rideau Canal. The responsibility for the 
              organization of a school committee and construction was given to 
              Thomas and James Ballantyne and Archibald Stewart donated land - 
              familiar names in the history of community.<br>
              <br>
              The school was built on the northeast corner of Centre St. (Concord 
              North) and Fifth St. (Harvey St.) and opened for students in September 
              of 1875. According to an article in the Ottawa Citizen (January 
              26, 1876), by the end of the year there were 74 students on the 
              register with an average attendance of over 50. The article described 
              the school as a &quot;neat wooden structure, 24 x 20 with 11 feet 
              of ceilings&quot;.<br>
              <br>
              This building served as the only school house in the village until 
              1890 when, under threat from the Provincial Education Department, 
              a more adequate building was constructed. With incorporation in 
              1888 as a village, the Ottawa Public School Board came into existence. 
              The records of this organization indicate that $2,497 was spent 
              to build the new brick school on the lot adjacent to the wooden 
              structure. This building, somewhat modified, still stands at 95/97 
              Concord St. North.<br>
              <br>
              By 1904 the average attendance was 113 students daily and the building 
              was no longer adequate even though the primary grades were still 
              housed in the old wooden structure. Finally in 1905, after years 
              of opposition from the village council, a $10,000 debenture was 
              allocated for a new school on Ella St. (Evelyn Ave.). The sod turning 
              took place on June 1, 1905 and by September the building was open 
              for students. Still standing, the school was later named Lady Evelyn 
              School.<br>
              <br>
              <b>First Separate Schools in the Ottawa East Area</b><br>
              <br>
              Towards the end of the 1890's pressure from the French-Canadian 
              and Catholic groups in the village for a new church and school had 
              increased dramatically. Suffering under oppressive provincial legislation 
              that precluded funding of separate schools from the public purse, 
              these communities turned to the Oblates for relief.<br>
              <br>
              In 1900, Monsignor Duhamel, the Archbishop of Ottawa, had the Oblate 
              Fathers of St. Joseph Scholasticate establish the Holy Family Parish 
              and a school to serve the community. The Grey Sisters of Ottawa 
              took charge of the school and classes for children in French and 
              English were started in 1901. Originally classes were held in the 
              famous 'White House' (Maison Blanche), a beautiful rustic wooden 
              structure built in the 1880's just a few feet from the main Scholasticate 
              building. The White House also served as the church until Ste. Famille 
              was built in 1902.<br>
              <br>
              Later a two storey, red brick school was built on the Oblate property 
              fronting on Main St. at Hazel St. and named Holy Family School. 
              A bilingual institution, it served the need of all Catholics until 
              1923 when De Mazenod School was created. Up to that point separate 
              instruction in French for many children in substandard, temporary 
              facilities including the church basement. In 1923 classes were being 
              held in the Graham house on the west side of Main St. With the death 
              of Alexander Graham, the property was purchased and in 1933 a modern 
              school was built with the same name.<br>
              <br>
              In 1930 the new parish of Canadian Martyrs was created following 
              the formation of the English Oblate Province. French-speaking parishioners 
              remained at Ste. Famille. That year the name of Holy Family School 
              (Main at Hazel) was changed to Canadian Martyrs School. In 1943 
              the building was destroyed by fire. Due to wartime shortages of 
              steel there was a delay in building the new school. Finally in 1947, 
              the new 9-classroom school with the same name was built on Graham 
              Ave.<br>
              <br>
              Both the De Mazenod and Canadian Martyrs School buildings still 
              stand although not used as facilities for education of children 
              in the parishes.<br>
              <br>
              <b>Colleges and Universities</b><br>
              <br>
              Ottawa East of course has been fortunate to have several other institutions 
              of high learning over the years. These include St. Joseph College 
              (Scholasticate); St. Patrick's College, St. Paul University, Algonquin 
              College and the present-day Immaculata High School. The detail of 
              these various institutions is best described in other sections that 
              can be found using the links at the top of the page.<br>
