        <p align="left">By 1901 the Village of Ottawa East had existed for over 
          a decade as an incorporated municipality. The population had grown steadily 
          given that it provided a cheaper alternative to the higher taxes and 
          land prices of the city. Decidedly blue-collar, the major employers 
          were the railways, brickyards and lumber businesses. Council, under 
          the<a href="HTML%20Documents/Image%20Library/Canal/PA131875.jpg"><img src="HTML%20Documents/Image%20Library/Canal/sm/PA131875sm.jpg" width="200" height="136" align="right" border="0" alt="Canal Swing Bridge built in 1890"></a> 
          direction of the popular Reeve Henry Roche, was now more preoccupied 
          than ever with public works. Ratepayers were now demanding such luxuries 
          as wood plank sidewalks, drainage, a municipal water supply and electric 
          streetlights. There was only a small iron and wood swing bridge across 
          the canal (from Harvey to Cartier) that could not accommodate heavy 
          vehicles and the trolley car. People wanted a better bridge, better 
          schools and more churches. Ottawa East was growing up.</p>
        <p align="left">This 1901 description of the village has been cobbled 
          together from a number of sources that give a relatively accurate view 
          of the time period. The information however should be considered in 
          terms of &quot;circa 1901&quot;. For example, the <a href="HTML%20Documents/Image%20Library/Maps/Fire%20Insurance%20Maps/Fire%20Insurance%20Maps.htm">1912 
          Fire Insurance Maps </a>used here were apparently updated versions of 
          the 1902 series. Here the town hall is labelled as a school and this 
          is consistent with the records of the Roman Catholic Board minutes. 
          But the building was the same. Compare that to the visual record that 
          exists and it is clear that very little had changed. There were new 
          &quot;granolithic&quot; sidewalks and gates at the rail crossing but 
          it was the same village.</p>
